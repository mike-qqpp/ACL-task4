        "doc": "Patient management software (PMS) is referred to as software that is regulated as a medical device. It is software that is used to acquire medical information from a medical device to be used in the treatment or diagnosis of a patient. It can also be software that is an adjunct to a medical device and directly contributes to the treatment of the patient by performing analysis, or providing treatment or diagnosis functionality that replaces the decision and judgment of a physician.\nMedical devices are classified and these classifications became somewhat less restrictive in December, 2010. Regulations provide rules for classifying medical devices into four increasing risk levels : Class I, Class II, Class III, and Class IV. Patient management software is classified as either Class I or Class II. Software that is intended to be used to view images, or other real time data, as an adjunct to the monitoring device itself, for the purpose of aiding in treatment or diagnosis of a patient, would be Class I medical devices. Medical device software that is an adjunct to another medical device and is involved in data manipulation, data analysis, data editing, image generation, determination of measurements, identification of a region of interest in an image, or identification (by an alarm or alert) of results from a monitor that are outside of an established range, is a Class II medical device if it: (1) provides the only means and opportunity to capture or acquire data from a medical device for aiding directly in diagnosis or treatment of a patient; or (2) replaces a diagnostic or treatment decision made by a physician.Examples of patient management software are PACS, remote patient monitoring. Others include any medical device that is used to transmit data from a medical device or analyze data from a medical device such as blood pressure monitors and glucose monitors.\nMany in the health care industry have raised concerns over the quality and software development process of PMS. The development of PMS is often criticized as too focused on simply the software development process and not the product. Much of these concerns are rooted in safety issuesComputerized physician order entry, an example of PMS, highlights some of these safety concerns.\nOther criticisms are aimed at the regulations in place. Some critics argue that regulations stifle innovation and that vendors will no longer have any incentive to create new products. Also, existing and future products will have to adhere to strict licensing procedures and this may affect the sustainability of these products.\nAnother concern is that the rules are disproportionately strict in comparison to the actual risk associated with a wide variety of eHealth systems and this may prevent companies from initiating the development of new products.\nRegulation of patient management software applies to anyone importing, distributing or selling the software. Health Canada is responsible for regulating the sale, advertising and distribution of patient management software in Canada. Regulated software is classified based on risk increasing from Class I to Class II.The type of license required depends on the classification of the software. An establishment license is required from a vendor or manufacturer of Class I PMS and a medical device license is required from a vendor or manufacturer of Class II PMS. ISO 13485 certification is required of manufacturers of Class II medical devices.\nIn August, 2009, Health Canada which is responsible for regulating the advertising, manufacturing and sale of medical devices in Canada issued a notice confirming that patient management software is a medical device and is subject to the Medical Devices Regulations and the Food and Drugs Act.  The development of the regulation of patient management software as a medical device began three years earlier when a company called MedManager created a patient portal technology that was deemed a Class II medical device and subject to regulation by Health Canada. Developments had taken place thereafter, to indicate that medical device classification include patient management software. A notice was officially released by Health Canada in August, 2009 indicating that patient management software was indeed a medical device.Therefore, organizations that import, sell or otherwise distribute Class I patient management software must have an establishment license and Class II patient management software must have a medical device licence. In order to obtain a medical device licence, manufacturers must hold a quality management system (QMS) certificate issued by an accredited registrar showing that the QMS is compliant with ISO 13485 Medical devices : Quality management systems : requirements for regulatory purposes. Organizations are also required to perform certain post-market responsibilities such as maintaining distribution and complaint handling records, mandatory problem reporting and recalls.\nIn December, 2010, a notice was released by Health Canada further clarifying the definition, classification and licensing requirements of software regulated as a medical device. For example, software used to transmit data from a medical device, or software that analyzes data from a medical device and makes diagnostic or treatment decisions normally made by a physician, would be considered software regulated as a medical device. A product that only stores and displays patient information is not a medical device. Examples of software that are not medical devices are middleware, EHR's including those that are custom built for use only within the organization, applications that perform administrative calculations and manipulations (such as determining time between appointments, or workflow management), the Wii Fit video game, personal BMI calculators and pedometer software used for fitness. The regulations apply to software that is distributed with or without compensation.\n",

        "doc": "Smell as evidence of disease has been long used, dating back to Hippocrates around 400 years BCE. It is still employed with a focus on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in body odor. VOCs are carbon-based molecular groups having a low molecular weight, secreted during cells' metabolic processes. Their profiles may be altered by diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders, genetic disorders, infections, and among others. Abnormal changes in VOC composition can be identified through equipment such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS), electronic nose (e-noses), and trained non-human olfaction.\nPhysicians historically used odors as a diagnostic indicator to judge a patient's health. Hippocrates saw the breath of patients as a potential indicator in around 400 BCE. Galen, Avicenna, and other physicians considered urine scent alongside color, density, sediments, and more in urinalysis. Urine with a sweet odor was diagnosed as possessing dominating sanguine humor relative to the other three humors; pungent odor as an excessive amount of bile; and foul odor as the presence of ulcers in the urinary tract or development of putrefactive fever, a fever occurring in the humors.VOCs are currently deemed as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers with the potential for point-of-care (POC) testing and long-term monitoring.\nThe biochemical mechanism of VOC generation in the human body is not fully comprehended. Their occurrence is due to changes in cell metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress, where reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from cellular respiration interact with cellular structures (such as the membrane, proteins, DNA, and RNA) to create VOCs. The accumulation occurs in breath, skin, sweat, blood, urine, and faeces. The samples can be analyzed by various methods, such as selected-ion-flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and more, but the commonly used technologies are gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electric nose (e-nose). The difference in samples and methods of analysis chosen may explain the high heterogeneity observed in VOCs identified in different studies pertaining to the same diseases.Electronic nose (e-noses) is a standard method used for non-compound-specific identification where arrays of broadly tuned sensors capture patterns or fingerprints of VOCs to distinguish between healthy and diseased individuals. The limitation of this method is the inability to identify individual biomarkers, implying unique biomarkers for diseases can not be discovered.Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is considered the gold standard for VOC analysis to identify specific compounds. The chromatography separates the sample mixture in a gaseous state by forcing them through a column using a carrier gas, and the mass spectrometer identifies the compound. The limitation of this method is the requirement of expensive specialized equipment and highly trained personnel.VOC analysis is seen in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, infections, and among others.\nLung cancer-specific VOCs are 1-propanol, endogenous primary alcohol, and pentane. Pentane's presence in exhaled breath of patients has been hypothesized to originate from the increased peroxidation of fatty acids seen in severe lung disease. Foul-smelling p-cresol was solely found in colorectal and gastric cancer, expected to be caused by cancer's alteration of the microbiome. No singular compound could be exclusively considered a biomarker, but VOCs patterns observed may aid in distinguishing between certain diseases.People with diabetes were found to have an increased concentration of ketones, the cause of sweet urine smell, derived from the oxidation of non-esterified fatty acids. Exhaled acetone is often used as a biomarker, but its relevance as a sole biomarker for diabetes is ambiguous. Acetone is considered a biomarker in other diseases, such as lung cancer and cystic fibrosis (CF), and reports on acetone and blood glucose have been mixed.Maple syrup urine disease, characterized by a strong maple syrup scent in urine, is found to have higher keto acid levels.\nThe breath of patients infected with Aspergillus fumigatus, a fungus responsible for invasive aspergillosis, showed the presence of 2-pentylfuran, a compound not ordinarily produced in mammalian metabolism. VOC profiles may be confounded by intakes of peanuts, soy milk, and more, which also display 2-pentylfuran.Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) had a significantly higher level of ethane than individuals without CF, correlating with increased carbon monoxide levels and obstructed airways. For CF caused by P. aeruginosa infection, hydrogen cyanide, 2-aminoacetophenone, and methyl thiocyanate were identified as potential breath biomarkers.\nDogs have been used to diagnose symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with metabolic and infectious diseases because of their highly sensitive olfaction due to a higher neuron packing density and threefold the number of functional genes encoding olfactory receptors relative to humans. This increase in receptors results in dogs possessing a 10,000 to 100,000 times higher accuracy in specially recognizing chemical messengers than humans. They have been frequently used to diagnose asymptomatic individuals with various infectious diseases such as SARS CoV-2, H1N1 Influenza, malaria, bovine virus infection, etc.The first study on trained dogs used for the detection of cancer was published by Willis et al. in 2004, observing that dogs were capable of detecting bladder cancer from urine samples.  Subsequently, in 2004, Pickel et al. confirmed that dogs were able to successfully diagnose melanoma. In 2008, Horvath et al. confirmed dogs were successful in differentiating between cancerous and normal tissue and in distinguishing non-cancerous pathological tissue from cancerous tissue. Another study by Horvath et al. in 2010 found the dogs to show over 90% specificity in detecting ovarian cancer from blood samples, colorectal cancer from respiratory air, and prostate cancer from dog urine.The first study on dogs used for the detection of infectious diseases was conducted by Bomers et al. in 2012. The dogs were trained with food rewards to detect individuals with C. difficile diarrhea, and the results showed 100% specificity and sensitivity in the detection in stool samples.  They were also capable of surveilling C. difficile in the environment with 92.3% sensitivity and 95.4% specificity for both odor detection and the ability to locate the source. Vancouver Canada hospital's canine scent recognition program also reported observing dogs' promising ability to detect C. difficile on hospital surfaces, equipment, and C. difficile reservoirs.The advantage of using trained dogs to detect C. difficile compared to the traditional culture-based diagnostic method is the fast detection speed, which only takes a few minutes. Whether sniffing dogs could be universally employed for diagnosing C. difficile is dubious as although it yields the results faster than the preexisting nucleic amplification test, its responsiveness is significantly lower.\nDogs have been trained to sniff SARS CoV-2-related VOCs since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Their overall success rates of detection were similar to or higher than reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen testing procedures. Grandjean et al. trained the dogs to sit in front of samples from COVID-19 positive patients.  The success rate of distinguishing the sweat odor of individuals with COVID-19 from individuals without COVID-19 was between 83% and 100%. In principle, the dogs could be used to screen individuals with various stages of COVID-19 infections (including asymptotic, presymptomatic individuals with mild to severe symptoms) in different settings such as schools, transportation centers like airports, hospitals, and public gatherings. An advantage of using trained dogs compared to primates or cats to detect COVID-19 is that dogs are animal species with a low risk of binding between ACE2 receptor and SARS CoV-2, making them less likely to be transmitters. To further minimize the risk of transmission to dogs, sniffing sweat (which has low transmission property) is deemed the ideal mechanism for dogs to detect COVID-19. Other advantages of using dogs for screening COVID-19 over the current RT-PCR method are lower cost, decreased intrusiveness to the subjects, and no delay in reporting the results.African giant pouched rats were trained to diagnose more than 14000 tuberculosis patients by smelling sputum. Compared to dogs capable of sniffing around 10 samples of C. difficile in stool or E.coli in urine per day, rats could sniff up to 100 samples in 20 minutes. Their success rates of detection were comparable to smear examination by microscopy after Ziehl-Neelsen staining with a responsiveness of 94% (which are common tools to diagnose tuberculosis in low-income countries). Their sensitivity was lower in comparison to nucleic acid amplification tests (80%) and with culture (60:70%). The rats were regarded as a good diagnostic tool for tuberculosis despite their lower responsiveness than nucleic acid tests when diagnostic settings are highly endemic countries with peripheral medical centers without proper laboratory set-ups.Mosquitoes were found to be attracted to skin odors of individuals infected by malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes). The attraction of uninfected mosquitoes was two to three times higher in children infected with gametocytes, and the attraction resumed to baseline following successful antimalarial treatments. Further investigation found a consistent effect of malaria on skin VOC profiles among populations with high malaria rates, where the infected showed a higher level of aldehydes heptanal, octanal, and nonanal, and notable distinguishable effects of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.",

In a hospital or sanitorium, this may be done by ensuring good ventilation in an airy, sunny room or by housing patients outdoors in tents or other open forms of accommodation.  During the 20th century, such treatment was used for people with infectious respiratory diseases such as influenza or tuberculosis.\nIn the 1960s, researchers into biological warfare found that microbes such as Escherichia coli were killed when exposed to outdoor air but that, when they were enclosed, they would remain viable for longer.  They called this the open air factor but were unable to identify the exact mechanism or disinfecting agent.\nOpen-air schools were established in several countries to provide a healthy environment for sickly children, emphasising fresh air, good food and exercise.  In England, the first one opened at Bostall Wood in 1907 and, by the 1930s, there were over a hundred across the country.\n",

BEEs are provided both initial and advanced instruction at the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.\nDuring the 1970s, the United States Air Force (USAF) saw a need to implement measures to protect the health of their personnel. They took elements of Military Public Health and spun off a separate arm called Bioenvironmental Engineering. From that point on, Bioenvironmental Engineering had taken the lead in protecting the health of USAF workers.The original group of Bioenvironmental Engineers (BEEs) came to the Air Force from the U.S. Army in 1947 when the Air Force was formed. They were an outgrowth of the U.S. Army Sanitary Corps. Until 1964, Air Force BEEs were called Sanitary and Industrial Hygiene Engineers. They were Medical Service Corps (MSC) officers until the Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) was created in 1965.\nBetween 1960 and 1970, the BEE field grew from around 100 to 150 members. However, beginning in 1970, with the formation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the career field experienced an exponential growth in Federal regulations. These laws required BEEs to monitor Air Force operations for their effects on personnel and the environment. Several major catastrophes and other events focused keen Congressional interest on environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH), leading to new, mandatory compliance programs. Love Canal, Bhopal, atmospheric ozone depletion, and other incidents spawned new laws governing the Installation Restoration Program; Hazard Communication; community-right-to-know; Process Safety Management; and hazardous material inventory, control, and reduction. These have continually driven additional, corresponding requirements for BEEs.\nIn the early 1980s, a major shift in functions occurred. The clinical and sanitary aspects of the BEE program, (communicable disease, sanitary surveys, vector control, and occupational medicine) were turned over to the newly forming environmental health officers. This enabled the BEE force to concentrate its efforts on the industrial work place and the environment.\nThe importance of ensuring Air Force compliance with ESOH requirements is now higher than ever. Public awareness/concern/disclosure, the recognition of risk analysis/communication/management, loss of sovereign immunity of federal agencies, and the personal liability of commanders for environmental infractions are all impacting BEE surveillance programs. Increased environmental pollution prevention and occupational health preventive medicine programs are shifting the emphasis to avoiding problems before they occur.\nBioenvironmental Engineers conduct health risk assessments (HRAs) in and around workplaces, protecting Airmen and employees from the hazards associated with their duties, very similar in nature to industrial or occupational hygiene. HRAs with recommendations to reduce or eliminate risk are sent to relevant parties for their consideration and to advise them on the impacts and risks to their subordinates and their mission(s). BEEs fundamentally analyze and recommend controls for identified occupational health (OH) risks to include employee exposure to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) expanded standard chemicals listed under 29 CFR 1910 (Subpart Z), immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) conditions found within confined spaces, and musculoskeletal disorders introduced by ergonomic stresses (such as repetitive motion/vibration/biomechanical stresses). BEEs routinely monitor local exhaust ventilation systems controlling airborne hazards across an installation to limit exposures a worker may receive. In conjunction with ventilation, BEEs also oversee the Respiratory Protection Program associated with each installation; BEEs ensure personnel are trained on the proper wear of an occupationally-required respirator, have a respirator fit test conducted, and know how to properly don/doff their personal protective equipment to protect them from inhalation hazards imposed by their tasks. BEEs are the installation authority regarding hazardous materials and personal protective equipment certification for use on an Air Force Base. Though not required, common OH certifications attained by BEEs include: Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) through the Board for Global EHS Credentialing (formerly the American Board of Industrial Hygiene) and Certified Safety Professional (CSP) through the Board of Certified Safety Professionals.Bioenvironmental Engineers serve as installation liaisons for federal, state, and local organizations regarding drinking water quality and assess for environmental contaminants on Air Force Bases, annually publishing a consumer confidence report to keep the base populace informed on the quality of their drinking water. A frequent concern on Air Force Bases is exposure to occupational noise hazards, as tinnitus is the most prevalent service-connected disability claimed by veterans through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as of 2020, accounting for ~8% of all disabilities. To address this concern, BEEs routinely conduct noise dosimetry on personnel to identify and isolate excessive noise-producing equipment in the workplace. BEEs also conduct Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessments (OEHSA) to identify and mitigate risks to personnel from their jobs, duties, and environment on an Air Force Base and its GSUs. Additionally, BEEs assess indoor air quality for airborne dusts, fumes, mists, fogs, vapors, and gases, frequently quantifying through exposure monitoring and documentation of worker exposures. Furthermore, BEEs routinely monitor for Thermal Stress (to include heat stress and cold stress) on an installation and publish flag conditions associated with recommended work-rest cycles and hydration guidelines, allowing supervisors and workers to remain safe.Bioenvironmental Engineers typically concurrently serve as Installation Radiation Safety Officers (IRSO) and Installation Laser Safety Officers (LSO) on an Air Force Base and its GSUs, overseeing and authorizing the transport and use of radioactive materials, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Permits, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation sources, and lasers. A key component to protecting personnel from radiation is routine exposure monitoring, managed by the BEEs through a thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) program that maintains oversight of all radiation worker exposures installation-wide.Bioenvironmental Engineers serve as emergency responders and health risk advisors for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear hazards, incidents, and their associated personal protective equipment (or clothing). BEEs are also HAZWOPER-certified, providing risk assessments and communication regarding hazardous materials. However, what BEEs are typically known for on an installation is the customer-oriented service they provide in the form of gas mask fit tests. BEEs routinely respond to emergencies alongside Emergency Management.",

        "title": "Homeschooling_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic",
        "doc": "There was a resurgence of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic to help students return to school. Innovative parents sought to create solutions to their individual dilemmas by organizing local groups. These variations of homeschooling include micro schools and educational family co-ops. The first usually involves hired professionals to teach a small group of kids (similar to one-room schoolhouses). The second is a parent-organized co-operative where families take turns educating and minding their kids during the week. Both are largely available only to the well-off, as costs in time and money are high. 'Pandemic pod' is the fashionable term used to describe one of these arrangements where all group members agree to participate under well-defined and strictly enforced health rules.\nConsidering the overall racial and ethnic makeup of the U.S. population, and the relative size of each group, minority parents are much more likely to participate in learning pods: Parents identifying as Hispanic have the highest level of participation (22 %), followed by parents identifying as Black (17 %) and Asian (11 %). Among white parents the participation rate was 17 %. In addition, minority parents display significantly more interest in forming or joining learning pods (Hispanic, 29 %; Black, 21 %; Asian, 34 %) compared to white parents (18 %). Furthermore, parents identifying as special needs parents are considerably more likely to have their children in a learning pod (31 %) compared to non-special needs parents (14 %). Finally, parents with younger children (Kindergarten to 4th grade, 21 %; 5th to 8th grade, 24 %) tend to participate more in learning pods compared to parents with older children (9th to 12th grade, 14 %), and parents of younger children also display greater interest in forming or joining learning pods (Kindergarten to 4th grade, 27 %; 9th to 12th grade, 16 %).\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education forced school closures around the world. Parents are left to manage their children and it is causing economic, educational, political and psychological distress. A University of California, San Francisco study states that schools can't open safely until COVID-19 transmission in a general population is under control.\nAs schools have been closed to cope with the global pandemic, students, parents and educators around the globe have felt the unexpected ripple effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. While governments, frontline workers and health officials are doing their best slowing down the outbreak, education systems are trying to continue imparting quality education for all during these difficult times. Most public schools have turned to online, distance learning in an attempt to re-engage students back into school. Many students at home/living space have undergone psychological and emotional distress and have been unable to engage productively. Lack of social interaction and face to face engagement between students and their teachers, or peers, has decreased student's overall motivation. The requirements placed on parents to fill in the gaps as teachers aids and support the implementation of the curriculum through remote learning left parents questioning the reliability of online education. The best practices for online homeschooling are yet to be explored, and it is unclear if homeschooling, or any other mitigation effort, can prevent students from falling behind.\nTo mitigate the disruption of school closures, multiple educational structures have been proposed. These terms are used interchangeably and this makes it confusing for parents who are trying to figure out how to organize their lives this fall as most schools will only offer virtual instruction. But basically there are three distinct ideas: pandemic pods, micro schools, and family co-ops.\nA pandemic pods is a small group of people who are all taking similar precautions against catching the virus. For educational purposes, pandemic pods (also known as learning pods) are a composed group of students who learn together, in person, outside of a traditional school. A family unit living together is a natural pandemic pod — everyone is taking responsibility for everyone else's health outcomes. Learning pods take many forms, but they primarily offer the benefit of a smaller circle of students, which provides comfort from the coronavirus. It also gives the feeling of a more formal schooling option, in which parents can return to work and students could be in a learning environment that's much closer to the traditional setting.A family co-op is not a pandemic-related entity. Most family co-ops form to ease the economic pressures of child care among several families. Several families get together and agree to share afterschool care of all the kids on certain days. This arrangement frees each set of parents from childcare several times per week. If five families are involved, then each family can take responsibility for all kids once per week. Instead of money, this social arrangement trades in time. Family co-ops is a very old arrangement that has been extensively studied in academic literature.In early April 2020, Canadian authorities actively encouraged the formation of family bubble — two families (usually with kids) who would join together and share responsibility for each other.A micro school is some variation on the one-room school where parents hire a teacher to educate their children. Micro schools can be as small as just one family hiring a teacher or a group of parents makes arrangements for all of their children together, splitting the costs of such endeavor. The biggest advantage of micro schools is that parents have total control over their children's education, including the choice of teachers. Micro Schools can vary significantly in costs.Some parents created \"school pods\" of multiple families or hired tutors to instruct students by zoom.\nA pandemic educational family co-op is the cross of all three structures: the micro schools, the family co-ops, and the Pandemic pods. Pandemic educational family co-ops function just like the educational family co-ops but in addition to all of the rest, the pandemic version stresses pandemic precautions within the group. This is the most economical solution for parents that are stuck without \"brick and mortar\" schools to send their kids during the week.",

        "doc": "Value-based health care (VBHC) is a framework for restructuring health care systems with the overarching goal of value for patients, with value defined as health outcomes per unit of costs. The concept was introduced in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Olmsted Teisberg, though implementation efforts on aspects of value-based care began long before them in the 1990s. VBHC emphasizes systematic measurement of outcomes and costs, restructuring provider organizations, and transitioning toward bundled payments. \nWithin this framework, cost reduction alone is not seen as proper strategy for healthcare systems: health outcomes have to improve to enhance value. Although value-based health care is seen as a priority in many health systems worldwide, a global assessment in 2016 found many countries are only beginning to align their health systems with VBHC-principles. Additionally, several studies report incoherent implementation efforts, and there seem to be various interpretations of VBHC, both within and across countries.\nIn a value-based care model, providers would work with patients to determine a treatment plan, then measure the relevant clinical results over the course of the patient's treatment.There is debate as to whether patient experience and satisfaction with the quality of their care is a component of value-based care. Some argue that while patient satisfaction is often conflated with value-based care, satisfaction is predicated on the patient's experience of treatment, rather than its medical effectiveness. However, the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) states that patient experience is an integral component of healthcare quality, and that patient experience is in fact different from patient satisfaction. There is a relationship between patient experience and greater medical effectiveness associated with patient adherence to medical advice. It is for this reason that patient experience surveys, namely CAHPS surveys, are national reporting requirements for several value-based purchasing programs, such as the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program.\nCost reduction is a component of this model : for example, by making healthcare cost information more readily available to patients : but it may not be the primary goal from a patient perspective, though it may be an important consideration from the perspective of payers, purchasers, and providers with an interest in the promise of maximizing outcomes per unit of cost inherent to VBHC.\n",

        "doc": "(Anna) Kate Rew (born 11 September 1969) is a swimmer, author, journalist and founder of The Outdoor Swimming Society. Rew lives in Somerset.\nKate Rew was born in Devon, England, where she grew up with a deep connection to the natural world. The picturesque landscapes and waterways of Devon played a significant role in shaping her love for outdoor activities, particularly swimming in the River Culm. She attended the University of Oxford.Kate Rew is best known as a pioneer of the outdoor swimming movement in the United Kingdom. She founded The Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS) in 2006, an organisation dedicated to promoting and supporting outdoor swimming in natural waters. Under her leadership, The OSS has grown to become a significant community, inspiring hundreds of thousands to take up outdoor swimming around the world.Rew is also an accomplished author and journalist. Her first book, \"Wild Swim\" (Faber), published in 2008, combined personal anecdotes, practical advice, and original photography to celebrate the joys and challenges of swimming in natural waters. The book was praised for its inspirational content and its role in popularising wild swimming, and became a bestseller. Her second book, \"The Outdoor Swimmers' Handbook' (Rider, 2022), brought together art, sport and science to teach readers everything they may need to enjoy swims in any water body.\nIn addition to her book, Kate has written numerous articles for prominent publications, as well as featuring on TV, radio and blogs, sharing her insights and experiences related to outdoor swimming and the natural environment. Her writing often emphasizes the physical and mental health benefits of swimming in natural settings, as well as the sense of adventure and connection to nature it provides.\nIn 2009 the news and lifestyle periodical Monocle magazine named her as one of its 20 \"global heroes who deserve a bigger stage worldwide\". In 2016 she received the Paragon Award from the International Swimming Hall of Fame in California, America for her 'stalwart contributions' to recreational swimming.Event Director & Charity Fundraiser Rew launched the first mass market open water swim in the UK in 2006, a charity swim called Breaststrokes in Windermere which raised money for Cancer Research UK. Breastrokes ran in Windermere and in Serpentine in 2006 and 2007, raising over £250k for the charity, which Rew had a loyalty to as a result of her mother's experiences of breast cancer.\nShe went on to found and run some of Britain's most iconic swim events the Dart10k (2009), The Bantham Swoosh and the Hurly Burly. She began a partnership with charity Level Water, which offers swimming lessons to children with disabilities, in 2016, and the events raised millions for the charity before being taken on by them in 2022. She continues to support the charity through The OSS, saying 'The OSS is proud of our substantial and longstanding role in helping this charity level things up, kickstarting a love of swimming in disabled children who might otherwise not have access to it'.\nThrough The OSS and events she has also mobilised swimmers in support of Surfers Against Sewage and Project Seagrass.\nRight to Swim & Community Advocate Rew champions the everyday swimmer in her work. She has written and appeared in short films such as Chasing The Sublime to share her philosophy that 'there is always fear on a swim, of discomfort and risk' but that it is through this the sublime is reached. Chasing The Sublime appeared on Oprah Winfrey's SuperSoul Sunday.\nIn the UK, Rew has been vocal on the need for a greater legal access to reservoirs and other bodies of water through her work on 'Right to Swim', and together with the OSS Inland Access Group and Sheffield Outdoor Plungers (SOUP), she started a Kinder Swim Trespass in 2021 which has grown into an annual and now nationwide fixture.\nWith a view to making swimming more accessible in urban environments worldwide, she is a founding partner of the Swimmable Cities network.\n",

        "doc": "Anxiety buffer disruption theory (ABDT) is an application of terror management theory to explain an individual's reaction to a traumatic event, which leads to post traumatic stress disorder. Terror management theory posits that humans, unlike any other organism, are uniquely aware that death is the inevitable outcome of life. When thoughts of death are made salient, such as when a terrorist attack carries those thoughts into the level of consciousness, humans are subject to debilitating anxiety unless it can be \"buffered.\" Humans respond to the anxiety and dread mortality salience produces by clinging  to their cultural worldview, through self-esteem and also close personal relationships. Cultural worldviews, with their cultural norms, religious beliefs and moral values infuse life with meaning. They give life a feeling of normalcy and also a feeling of control. There is no way to definitely prove one's cultural worldview, there they are fragile human constructs and must be maintained. Clinging to a cultural worldview and self-esteem buffer the anxiety connected to thoughts of mortality. When thoughts of death are salient, humans are drawn to their cultural world view which \"stipulates appropriate social requirements, and standards for valued conduct, while instilling one's life with meaning, order and permanence.\"\nWhen a traumatic experience cannot be assimilated into a currently held cultural worldview, the anxiety-buffering mechanisms are disrupted. ABDT argues that individuals face overwhelming anxiety which leads to the symptoms of PTSD including re-experiencing, hyper-arousal, avoidance and disassociation. The dissociation causes atypical responses to mortality salience compared with individuals who do not have an anxiety buffer disruption. When the anxiety buffer disruption is mild, exaggerated coping responses, such as rejecting or taking offense at other cultures, is expected. When the anxiety buffer disruption is severe, there can be a total breakdown of coping mechanisms. The theory was proposed by Tom Pyszczynski and  Pelin Kesebir.\nIn 1992, Janoff-Bulman delineated a theory of trauma response (Shattered Assumptions Theory). Janoff-Bulman posits that humans have basic assumptions about the world in which they live, based on the belief that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that the individual has self-worth. These assumptions give the individual the illusion that they have a measure of control on their own lives as well as a feeling of invulnerability. When an individual faces a traumatic event, their deeply held beliefs that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that they have a worthy role in that world are shattered. The world is no longer benevolent or predictable.Terror management theory and anxiety buffer disruption theory have taken the concept one step further.\nAnxiety buffer disruption theory not only focuses on the thoughts and emotions of an individual, but it also studies the behavior that results when terror management theory and shattered assumptions theory are examined together. Excessive anxiety experienced by people with post-traumatic stress disorder occurs because the events causing the post-traumatic stress disorder have demonstrated to these individuals that anxiety-buffering mechanisms are not capable of protecting them from death. Individuals who have high levels of peritraumatic dissociation and low levels of self-efficacy coping, two indicators of post-traumatic stress disorder,  have abnormal responses to reminders of death. These individuals in turn do not utilize the coping mechanisms that are typically used to remove the fear of death: culture, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. In fact, in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder, mortality salience coping mechanisms are viewed as worthless and perhaps are even seen to be detestable.Cultural Worldview:  Individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder will often reject their culture when provided with mortality salience triggers, the direct opposite of what terror management theory demonstrates to be true in those without post traumatic stress disorder. Cultural worldviews infuse life with structure, purpose and meaning. People maintain these fragile constructions by preferring the company of the like-minded. But when faced with a traumatic event, there are times when the horror cannot be assimilated into the framework of the person's existing cultural worldview.Self-Esteem: Various studies demonstrate that individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder also have decreased self-esteem. Self-esteem cannot function well as an anxiety buffering system in those who have post traumatic stress disorder as the buffer is weakened in these individuals. High self-esteem can displace defensive responses and buffer against the terror of mortality salience because it is a signal that the individual is living at the standard they should, based on their world view. Self-worth as the terror management theory suggests is an essential component of the existential anxiety- buffering system. PTSD is related to a breakdown in this system, and noted that veterans with past and present, or ongoing PTSD have shown to have lower self-esteem. According to ABDT this leaves this group particularly vulnerable to anxiety, since self-worth is an integral part of the individual's anxiety- buffering mechanism.\nClose Relationships: It is often mentioned that worldview and self-esteem affect ways in which our fears of death are buffered with ABDT. Close relationships also serve as a regulator of these fears. Previous studies hinted at that close relationships played a role in terror management, but they did not conceptualize, theoretically explain, or test the context of close relationships in Terror Management Theories. Close relationships seem to be a product of natural selection because of their reproductive and survival benefits, having reproductive benefits contribute to the survival of people's genes through their offspring. Therefore, close relationships increase the likelihood of mating and brings about other survival skills like gathering food, finding shelter, environmental awareness, and protects offspring from dangers. Love and belongingness are ranked over those of esteem and self- actualization. The formation and maintenance of close relationships have been recognized in both infants and adults as a source of regulating distress. It is also noted that self- esteem can also stem from close relationships. Based on these things it was assumed that formation and maintenance of close relationships may serve as a death- anxiety- buffering mechanism.\nClose relationships appear to have inoculating power against basic existential threats, which allows people to respond to these threats by fulfilling relational potentials. Second, it seems the sense of relationship commitment is shaped by not only perceived relational investment, gains, and potential alternatives, as well as the existential need of denial of death awareness. Third, it seems processes of terror management not only include worldview defenses to protect the self, but also promote commitment to significant others and the expansion of the self, provided by these relationships. Close relationships may serve as a fundamental anxiety buffer. It appears close relationships not only protect individuals from concrete and actual threats or danger, but also offer a symbolic shield against the awareness of one's finitude. Since the threat of death is inescapable, the support from those close to us make may make the thought of death more tolerable by giving meaning to our lives by being important to others.\nAs other anxiety buffers, interpersonal relationships are damaged as well in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder. People with post traumatic stress disorder have higher rates of divorce, more difficulty with their children, are more prone to domestic violence, and are emotionally distant from loved ones. All of these are damaging and as a result, terror management cannot be accomplished through close interpersonal relationships.\nA study looked at dissociation responses and PTSD in students who survived the 2005 Zarand earthquake in Iran. The earthquake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, killed more than 1,500 people and displaced more than 6,700 for two months or more. It looked at dissociation one month later then two years later to see if level of dissociation predicted PTSD.Four weeks after the earthquake, researchers solicited for volunteers at local universities. All of the participants met the DSM-IV criterion for a Class A1 trauma. Many were wearing black mourning clothes or had injuries from the earthquake.\nThree priming conditions were employed: mortality salience, earthquake or dental pain. The researchers then evaluated  how the subjects felt toward foreign aid in the wake of the disaster. The results indicated that subjects with high dissociative tendencies showed no effect of mortality salience on attitudes toward the foreign aid. Subjects with low dissociative tendencies reacted as terror management theory predicts when confronted with mortality salience and thought of the earthquake.\nTwo years after the quake, the researchers returned and 172 of the original respondents participated. They predicted that subjects with high PTSD symptoms would have a disrupted worldview on both foreign aid and the Islamic dress code. They found a strong relationship between dissociation and subsequent PTSD symptom severity. Even after the passage of two years, subjects with high dissociative tendencies were still not defending against existential threats in a way typical for the population who has not experienced trauma.\n105 students of the University of Abidjan took the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version and then an opinion survey on the civil war in Côte d'Ivoire. Last, they took part in a word-completion task designed to measure their accessibility of death-related thoughts. This study, unlike previous studies related to terror management theory, looked at the subjects' thoughts of death as related to the war, a specific traumatic event.In the control condition, where subjects were asked to talk about their anxiety related to their worst exam, death thought accessibility was lower for those with higher levels of PTSD. This suggests that people with strong PTSD repress thoughts of death. But when mortality was made salient, it provoked a marked increase in death thought accessibility for those with high PTSD. The results indicate that the anxiety buffer of death thought suppression under normal circumstances failed when subjects were reminded of the traumatic event.\nA second experiment was conducted with 197 students of the University of Ajidjan where they evaluated exposure (proximity) to a traumatic event. In this case, it was geographical location to the civil war. The researchers hypothesized that subjects who lived where the fighting was more constant and intense would be more likely to increase their PTSD reports when mortality was made salient. Those who lived in an area of less conflict should not increase their reports of PTSD. As a form of defensive denial, the researchers predicted they might report lower levels of symptoms. As expected, subjects who had more exposure to war reported greater PTSD symptoms in the mortality salience condition.\n",

        "doc": "Religious identity is a specific type of identity formation. Particularly, it is the sense of group membership to a religion and the importance of this group membership as it pertains to one's self-concept. Religious identity is not necessarily the same as religiousness or religiosity. Although these three terms share a commonality, religiousness and religiosity refer to both the value of religious group membership as well as participation in religious events (e.g. going to church). Religious identity, on the other hand, refers specifically to religious group membership regardless of religious activity or participation.\nSimilar to other forms of identity formation, such as ethnic and cultural identity, the religious context can generally provide a perspective from which to view the world, opportunities to socialize with a spectrum of individuals from different generations, and a set of basic principles to live out. These foundations can come to shape an individual's identity.\nDespite the implications that religion has on identity development, the identity formation literature has mainly focused on ethnicity and gender and has largely discounted the role of religion. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies have begun to include religion as a factor of interest. However, many of these studies use religious identity, religiosity, and religiousness interchangeably or solely focus on religious identity and solely religious participation as separate constructs.\nOf these types of research studies, researchers have examined the various factors that affect the strength of one's religious identity over time. Factors that have been found to affect levels of religious identity include gender, ethnicity, and generational status.\n'Identity' is one of the most used terms in the social sciences and has different senses in different research paradigms. In addition to psychological studies, sociologists and anthropologists also apply the term 'religious identity' and examine its related processes in given social contexts. For example, one important study conducted in the United States after the events of September 11, 2001, explored the meaning-making among American Muslims and how changes in identity ascription (what people think about another group of people) affected how Muslims sought to represent themselves. Other studies have applied concepts appropriated from race and gender identity theory such as disidentification which undermines essentialist accounts of religious identity : that an individual has a 'fixed' religious identity, independent of pre-existing systems of representation and individuals' positioning within them.\nIndividuals who share the same religious identity are called coreligionists.\n",

        "doc": "The Sīladharā Order is a Theravada Buddhist female monastic order established by Ajahn Sumedho at Chithurst Buddhist Monastery, England. Its members are known as Sīladharās.\nIn 1983, he obtained permission from the Sangha in Thailand, to give a ten-precept pabbajjā to women, giving them official recognition as female renunciants trained in the Ajahn Chah lineage. The reasons for its establishment are due to the historical loss of the bhikkhunī (nun's) ordination in Theravada Buddhism, limiting renunciation for female Theravadins to ad hoc roles such as the thilashins and maechis, neither of which garner recognition from modern-day Theravada Buddhists as genuine renunciants.\nAjahn Sumedho enlisted Ajahn Sucitto to train the nuns from 1984 to 1991. By 2008, sīladharās were trained in the discipline of more than one hundred precepts, including rules based on the pāṭimokkha of the bhikkhunī order. The order waxed and waned throughout its brief history, peaking at around 14, mostly living at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery.In order to not violate national laws governing religious ordinations in predominantly Theravāda countries, with the notable exception of Sri Lanka, the Sīladharā Order is formally considered junior to that of bhikkhus or fully ordained men. Over the last twenty years, many siladhāras have therefore sought full bhikkhunī ordination with commensurate privileges, recognition and responsibilities enjoyed by male monastics. Making full ordination available to women is a cultural issue with significant implications for the welfare of young girls living in poverty in Asian countries where Theravada Buddhism is prevalent, especially Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Sri Lanka. Speaking of Thailand, Lynne Hybels writes, \"Young men in desperately poor families such as those in Chiang ai can bring honor to their families by becoming monks, but girls are expected to provide financially. Traffickers understand this vulnerability, prey on it, and easily lure girls into life in the brothel.\" Such ordinations, however, are according to Buddhism itself motivated by wrong view; in particular, by careerism or economism, rather than by a sense of saṁvega and genuine renunciation.After years of thorough discussion, Ajahn Sumedho issued a \"Five-Point Declaration\" concerning women's roles and rights in the Amaravati monastic community. This affirmed the status quo of seniority of male over female monastics. The declaration holds that while some teaching and management responsibilities are shared between the two orders according to capability, the Siladhara Order is unequivocally junior to that of the monks.\nMany consider the \"Five-Point Declaration\" to be discriminatory against women. Some monastics and scholars also consider it to be an inaccurate interpretation of the vinaya and other texts, similar to the Three-Fifths Compromise in the United States Constitution or other codified examples of discrimination such as coverture. In addition, the violations of national law that had been sought to avoid were distinct from the vinaya itself, as argued by Ajahn Brahmavaṁso on the same matter.\nDespite Ajahn Sumedho's best efforts at balancing contending interests, many female monastics living at Amaravati at the time left the monastery citing discrimination and lack of compassion on the part of Amaravati leadership. Subsequently, two sīladharās from this group founded a community in the United States. Along with numerous other women in recent years, these former Sīladharās have taken full bhikkhunī ordination.\n",

        "doc": "The Joshua Project is an evangelical Christian organization based in Colorado Springs, United States, which seeks to coordinate the work of missionary organizations to track the ethnic groups of the world with the fewest followers of evangelical Christianity. To do so, it maintains ethnologic data to support Christian missions. It also tracks the evangelism efforts among 17,446 people groups worldwide—a people group being \"the largest group within which the Gospel can spread as a church planting movement,\" according to the project's website—to identify people groups as of yet unreached by Christian evangelism.\nThe project began in 1995 within the former AD2000 and Beyond Movement, which itself sprang from the 1989 Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE) prior to the Second International Congress on World Evangelization. From 2001 through 2005 the Joshua Project was at different times informally connected with the Caleb Project, and the International Christian Technologists Association (ICTA) and World Help. In 2006, the Joshua Project officially became part of the U.S. Center for World Mission, later called the Venture Center.The goal of the project is to bring definition to the unfinished task of the Great Commission by providing accurate, regularly updated ethnic people group information critical for understanding the scope of the work required.\nFocusing on ethnicity, the project maintains a database of \"unreached peoples\" listed by country and language. As of 2010, they list 9,803 ethnic groups. These are further divided into 16,350 peoples-by-countries, counting national minorities individually for each of 236 countries, of which 6,642 are classified as \"unreached peoples\". Ethnic groups are organized hierarchically in 251 \"People Clusters\" which in turn are divided in 16 \"Affinity Blocs\" (Arab World, East Asians, Eurasians, Horn of Africa-Cushitic, Iranian-Median, Jews, Latin-Caribbean Americans, Malay peoples, North American peoples, Pacific Islanders, South Asians, Southeast Asians, Sub-Saharan Africans, Tibetan / Himalayan peoples, Turkic peoples and Unclassified). Each ethnicity is listed as speaking at least one of 6,510 languages.\n",

        "doc": "The relationship between Christianity and animal rights is complex, with different Christian communities coming to different conclusions about the status of animals. The topic is closely related to, but broader than, the practices of Christian vegetarians and the various Christian environmentalist movements.\nMany Christian philosophers and socio-political figures have stated that Christians should follow the example of Jesus and treat animals in a way that expresses compassion and demonstrates the respectful stewardship of humanity over the environment. William Wilberforce, a co-founder of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, is an example. Large organizations in which a variety of different groups work together, such as the Humane Society of the United States, have undertaken religious outreach using such arguments.\nAndrew Linzey has pointed out it would be wrong to see Christianity as an inherent enemy of animal rights since Christian theology, like all other religious traditions, has some unique insights into viewing animal life as having fundamental value.\nThroughout history, there have been Christian thinkers who have raised ethical questions about the moral status of animals. Francis of Assisi is perhaps the most well-known example.\nVarious church founders have recommended vegetarianism for ethical reasons, such as William Cowherd from the Bible Christian Church, Ellen G. White from the Seventh-day Adventists and John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. Cowherd helped to establish the world's first Vegetarian Society in 1847. Wesley's vegetarian views inspired a later generation to establish the American Vegetarian Society in 1850. Christian denominations like Seventh Day Adventists have central vegetarian doctrines incorporated.\nAlthough animal sacrifice is a theme in the Old Testament, the rise of Christianity brought an end to animal sacrifice in communities where it took hold. The concept of the Peaceable Kingdom found in the Hebrew Bible, describes peaceful coexistence of animals such as wolves and lambs.\n",

        "doc": "Astronauts and other spaceflight participants have observed their religions while in space; sometimes publicly, sometimes privately. Religious adherence in outer space poses unique challenges and opportunities for practitioners. Space travelers have reported profound changes in the way they view their faith related to the overview effect, while some secular groups have criticized the use of government spacecraft for religious activities by astronauts.\nOn Christmas Eve, 1968 astronauts Bill Anders, Jim Lovell, and Frank Borman read from the Book of Genesis as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon. A lawsuit by American Atheists founder Madalyn Murray O'Hair alleged that the observance amounted to a government endorsement of religion in violation of the First Amendment, but the case was dismissed.Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, a Presbyterian, performed a communion service for himself using a kit provided by his church. Aldrin had told flight director Chris Kraft of his plans and intended to broadcast the service back to Earth but opted not to at the request of Deke Slayton, due to the continuing controversy over Apollo 8's reading.A microfilm Bible brought to the surface of the Moon by Apollo 14 astronaut Ed Mitchell was auctioned off in 2011. It was a King James Version created after three astronauts lost their lives in the Apollo 1 fire. Ed White, one of the astronauts who perished, had wanted to take a Bible to the Moon.\nOn the 2009 STS-128 flight to the International Space Station, astronaut Patrick Forrester brought a fragment of a Missionary Aviation Fellowship aircraft which had been used by the Operation Auca martyrs in Ecuador in 1956.\nSeveral members of the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy mission STS-51-L were people of faith.  Among them were Commander Dick Scobee and Pilot Michael J. Smith.  Scobee was a Baptist who met his wife June at a church social event.  After the tragedy, she would go on to write an article in Guidepost Magazine about how their faith helped her through the tragic time.  Smith and his family attended a non-denominational Christian church in a community close to their home near Houston's NASA JSC Space Center.\nRick Husband, the Commander of the ill-fated STS-107 Columbia tragedy mission, was also a devout Christian. On the last-request forms that astronauts fill out before every flight, he left his pastor a personal note: \"Tell them about Jesus; he's real to me.\"  Later his wife Evelyn wrote a book about their life with him as an astronaut and the importance of their Christian faith entitled High Calling: The Courageous Life and Faith of Space Shuttle Columbia Commander Rick Husband.  Likewise, his STS-107 crewmate Michael P. Anderson was also a devout Christian and when not on a mission for NASA, was an active member of the Grace Community Church choir.\nA signed message from Pope Paul VI was included among statements from dozens of other world leaders left on the Moon on a silicon disk during the Apollo 11 mission. Following the mission, William Donald Borders, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando, told the Pope that the 1917 Code of Canon Law placed the Moon within his diocese, as the first explorers had departed from Cape Kennedy which was under his jurisdiction. The claim was neither confirmed nor denied by the Pope, and the Moon is not recognized as part of the diocese in any official capacity.Following Buzz Aldrin's communion on the Moon, other astronauts have  done the same in Earth orbit. Three Catholic astronauts on Space Shuttle mission STS-59 received Holy Communion on 17 April 1994. NASA astronaut Michael S. Hopkins took a supply of six consecrated hosts to the International Space Station in September 2013, allowing him to receive the Eucharist weekly during his 24-week mission.\nIn May 2011, Pope Benedict XVI of the Catholic Church talked to the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour while it was in Earth orbit.\nIn Russia, spaceflight crews are blessed by Russian Orthodox priests before launch, and their Soyuz rockets are also blessed on the launch pad. Cosmonaut Aleksandr Viktorenko initiated the crew blessing tradition when he requested one for the launch of Soyuz TM-20 in 1994.Russian Orthodox Christmas was celebrated on the International Space Station, on January 7, 2011. Cosmonauts had the day off, but one of the other crew posted on Twitter, \"Merry Christmas to all Russia.\" The whole crew also celebrated on December 25, two weeks prior.\nCosmonauts sometimes at the request of Russian Orthodox church carry religious icons to space, which upon return to Earth are distributed to churches.\nMuslims in space struggle with fulfilling their religious obligations including kneeling and facing Mecca to pray in microgravity traveling at several kilometres per second. The issue first came up when Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, a Saudi prince, flew aboard STS-51-G and again when Anousheh Ansari flew as a tourist to the International Space Station. In preparation for Malaysian Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor's trip to the ISS in 2007, the National Fatwa Council created \"Muslim Obligations in the International Space Station\" outlining permissible modifications to rituals such as kneeling when praying (not required in space), facing Mecca (or just Earth) when praying (left to the astronaut's best abilities at the start of prayer), and washing (a wet towel will suffice).In February 2014, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowment (GAIAE) from Saudi Arabia issued a fatwa forbidding devout Muslims from participating as crew members in Mars One's proposed one-way mission to Mars. Speaking for the clerical group, Farooq Hamada explained that, \"Protecting life against all possible dangers and keeping it safe is an issue agreed upon by all religions and is clearly stipulated in verse 4/29 of the Holy Quran: Do not kill yourselves or one another. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful.\"\nTime and date-related observances are important in Judaism, and there have been considerations on the observance of time by Jewish astronauts.American astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman took multiple Jewish objects to space on his space flights from 1985 to 1996: a miniature Torah scroll, a yad, a Torah breastplate, mezuzot, menorahs, a dreidel, hand-woven tallit, and kiddush cups.\nIn January 2003, a microfilm Torah, a handwritten copy of the Shabbat kiddush, and a miniature Torah scroll rescued from the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp were taken to space by Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia. Ramon and the rest of the crew died when the shuttle disintegrated during reentry. In September 2006, Canadian astronaut Steve MacLean took another Torah from Bergen-Belsen aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis to the International Space Station as a tribute to Ramon.\nIn December 2006, American astronaut Sunita Williams took a copy of the Bhagavad Gita to the International Space Station. In July 2012, she took there an Om symbol and a copy of the Upanishads. On 27 February 2021, PSLV-C51 carried a digital copy of the Bhagavad Gita into space on an SD card.",

        "title": "Counter-apologetics",
        "doc": "Within criticism of religion, counter-apologetics is a field of thought that criticizes religious apologetics. Every religious apologist criticizes the defense of other religions, though the term counter-apologetics is frequently applied to criticism of religion in general by freethinkers and atheists. Luke Muehlhauser, the former executive director of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, defines counter-apologetics as \"a response to Christian apologetics...examining the claims and tactics of Christian apologists and then equipping [a thinker] with skeptical responses to them\".\nChristian apologist and blogger J.W. Wartick wrote \"counter-counter apologetics\" in response to Matt Dillahunty's Iron Chariots counter-apologetics encyclopedia, named for a passage in Judges 1 in which God was unable to lead the Israelites to victory over an enemy because that enemy had chariots of iron.\nOn his blog, as part of his \"why they don't believe\" series (\"why they reject Christianity and/or theism\"), Christian apologist and theologian Randal Rauser invited an anonymous blogger who calls himself Counter Apologist to explain his counter-apologetics, and Rauser provided his own counter-arguments.\nThe New Testament is well understood to contain apologetics, but counter-apologetics also appears in Christian theology. Theologian John Milbank has written in a 2012 work that Christianity \"makes room for\" counter-apologetics by not being a Gnostic system of thought, and notes the \"authentic Christian fusion of apologetic and counter-apologetic\" as it stands in opposition to the anti-materialist nihilism of Browning's Caliban. Likewise, Biblical scholar and theologian  Loveday Alexander has written that analysis of the Bible's books Luke and Acts by two other authors shows they contain counter-apologetic features perhaps to convey a pro-Roman perspective to the reader.\n",

        "doc": "The Flushing Remonstrance was a 1657 petition to Director-General of New Netherland Peter Stuyvesant, in which some thirty residents of the small settlement at Flushing requested an exemption to his ban on Quaker worship. It is considered a precursor to the United States Constitution's provision on freedom of religion in the Bill of Rights.\nIn 1645, New Netherland governor Willem Kieft granted a patent to a group of English colonists from the New England Colonies to settle in the colony. The majority of the colonists settled down in the newly established colonial settlement of Vlissingen. Kieft's patent granted the English colonists, most of them non-Anglican Protestants, the same freedom of religion which existed in the Dutch Republic, which was one of the most religiously tolerant nations in Europe.Eleven years later, new governor Peter Stuyvesant, having adopted a hardline stance towards the practice of any faiths which were not part of the Dutch Reformed Church (including the various forms of Protestantism practised by the English colonists), issued an ordinance in 1656 which formally proscribed all religious congregations in the colony not part of the Reformed Church. Stuyvesant's ordinance, which was immensely controversial in the colony, stood against the approximately hundred-year development of religious tolerance in the Dutch Republic. During this period when the Dutch were revolting against Spanish rule, rebelling against an imposed Inquisition, attempting to form a national identity, and trying to unify Calvinist and Catholic provinces. The Dutch toleration debates were lengthy, bumpy, heated, and full of political intrigue and even assassination. The writer Thomas Broderick states, \"I believe the true Dutch legacy is not one of toleration but of discussion. New Amsterdam and the Republic show us that a robust, open public discourse is the surest way to eventual social improvement. Toleration and acceptance are political and moral imperatives, and the Flushing remonstrance and great Dutch toleration debates in Europe and North America teach us that social change takes time, open dialogue, disagreement, and failure before progress is to be made.\"\nStuyvesant's policy was not very different from the one evolving in the Netherlands: an official recognition of the Dutch Reformed Church bundled with broad tolerance within the church and a policy of connivance, turning a blind eye to non-conformist religious practices. At the same time, Stuyvesant also opposed Jewish arrival in New Amsterdam. On another front, the Stuyvesant family was broadly tolerant.  Judith, Stuyvesant's wife, was a fierce advocate for New York's slaves, promoting the practice of baptism as a first step toward freedom.\nHis policy met with resistance from many English colonists in Vlissingen, Rustdorp and 's-Gravesande, all of which had been host to previous Quaker missions.  Stuyvesant's actions, however, also met with the support of other English colonists, including local magistrates, who informed on those embracing unorthodox teachings and meeting in small and unsanctioned religious meetings of lay people called conventicles.  Thus, Stuyvesant found himself drawn into the religious debates of the English Atlantic World and debates in England which culminated in the Conventicle Act 1664.\nThis policy resulted in numerous acts of religious persecution and harassment.  In 1656 William Wickenden, a Baptist minister from Rhode Island, was arrested by Dutch colonial authorities, jailed, fined, and exiled for baptizing Christians in Flushing. In the same year Robert Hodgson was arrested, tried, and sentenced to two years of manual labor with slaves for his preaching of Quakerism. In 1661, in the town of Rustdorp, Henry Townsend (Norwich) and Samuel Spicer were fined for holding Quaker conventicles and Townsend was banished as well.  Stuyvesant sent three new magistrates, all English colonists, and six colonial militiamen to gather information on dissidents. The militiamen were billeted in the homes of the dissidents until they agreed to conform.  In 1662, in 's-Gravesande, Samuel Spicer and his mother, Micha, along with John and Mary Tilton were imprisoned and later banished.  They moved to Oyster Bay, then outside of the authority of New Netherland, and returned to their town after 1664 when the English took control of the colony.\nThe Flushing Remonstrance was signed at the home of Edward Hart, the town clerk, on December 27, 1657, by a group of Dutch citizens who were affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of Stuyvesant. None of them were Quakers. The site of the signing is presently occupied by the former State Armory, now a police facility, on the south side Northern Boulevard between Linden Place and Union Street. The Remonstrance ends with:In response Stuyvesant dismissed the local government and chose new Dutch replacements as leaders.  Four who signed were arrested by order of Stuyvesant. Two immediately recanted, but the writer of the remonstrance, Edward Hart, and sheriff of Flushing Tobias Feake remained firm in their convictions. Both men were remanded to prison where they survived in isolation on rations of bread and water for over a month. After friends and family petitioned Stuyvesant on behalf of the elderly Hart, the clerk was released on penalty of banishment. Feake held out for a few more weeks, but eventually recanted and was pardoned after being fined and banned from holding public office.\nStuyvesant asserted that he was not violating the signers' \"freedom of conscience,\" only their right to worship outside of family prayer meetings. In addition he proclaimed March 13, 1658 a Day of Prayer for the purpose of repenting from the sin of religious tolerance.\nSubsequently, John Bowne of the colony allowed Quakers to meet in his house. He was arrested in 1662 and brought before Stuyvesant. Unrepentant, Bowne was sentenced to banishment to the Dutch Republic, though he was of English descent and spoke no Dutch. After several months in Europe, Bowne petitioned the directors of the Dutch West India Company. After a month of deliberation, the Dutch West India Company agreed to support Bowne, and advised Stuyvesant by a letter (1663) that he was to end religious persecution in the colony. One year later, in 1664, the colony was captured by English forces. The John Bowne House, built before 1662, still stands in historic preservation.\nThe Quaker Meeting House in Flushing, built 1694, is now the oldest house of worship in continuous use in New York State.\nThe 30 signers were:Hart signed first as clerk of the group; each of several other signers wrote an X that is labeled as their mark.\nJohn Bowne's account of the Flushing Remonstrance and its aftermath is found in his journal of events.  Bowne, who had arrived in 1651, soon began to host Quaker meetings in his home, although he did not convert until 1659.  He was to become a leader of American Quakers and a correspondent of Quaker founder George Fox.The earliest version of the document in English dates also from 1657 as an official copy of the original, but the original, likely in Dutch, has been lost. This early handwritten copy suffered singeing in the burning of the New York State Capitol in 1911, yet remains essentially complete. It has seldom been in public anywhere.The Queens Borough President's Office held a celebration of the 350th anniversary of the Remonstrance in 2007. Descendants of the signers, Bowne, Stuyvesant, and the arresting officer were invited and in attendance, and the original copy of the Remonstrance was brought down from the State Archives in Albany for several weeks' public display.\nBowne Park, John Bowne High School, and an elementary school in Flushing, Queens are named in John Bowne's honor.\nPS 21 in Flushing is named after Edward Hart, the writer of the Remonstrance.\n",

        "doc": "Animal faith is the study of animal behaviours that suggest proto-religious faith. It is commonly believed that religion and faith are unique to humans, largely due to the typical dictionary definition of the word religion (see e.g. Wiktionary or Dictionary.com) requiring belief in a deity, which has not been observed in non-human animals. However, by using a \"non-anthropocentric and non-anthropomorphic prototype definition\" of religion, such as the one developed by James Harrod in his 2011 work \"A Trans-Species Definition of Religion,\" scientists can study animal religious practices and behaviors.\nRitual behaviors are most commonly studied in chimpanzees, elephants, and dolphins, but such behaviors have also been observed in other animals, such as magpies, crows and orcas.\nTheologian and biologist Oliver Putz notes that, since chimpanzees are capable of moral agency, it is possible for Christians to understand them as having been made in the image of God. Furthermore, Nancy R. Howell suggests that \"chimpanzees and bonobos may have the precursors for culture and spirituality, such as connectedness, interdependence and sociality and a level of 'symbolic capacity'\". Primatologist Jane Goodall goes further, noting that some chimpanzees may \"dance\" at the onset of heavy rain or when they come across a waterfall. She speculates that \"their 'elemental' displays are precursors of religious ritual\".Pliny the Elder reported supposed elephant reverence for the celestial bodies:The elephant is the largest of them all, and in intelligence approaches the nearest to man. It understands the language of its country, it obeys commands, and it remembers all the duties which it has been taught. It is sensible alike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degree that is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty, prudence, and equity; it has a religious respect also for the stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon.\nWhile grief is common to many animals, funeral rituals are not. However, they are well documented in African elephants.Ronald K. Siegel writes that:\none cannot ignore the elaborate burying behaviour of elephants as a similar sign of ritualistic or even religious behaviour in that species. When encountering dead animals, elephants will often bury them with mud, earth and leaves. Animals known to have been buried by elephants include rhinos, buffalos, cows, calves, and even humans, in addition to elephants themselves. Elephants have [been] observed burying their dead with large quantities of food, fruit, flowers and colourful foliage.\nBoth wild and captive chimpanzees engage in ritualized behaviors at the death of a group member. These behaviors begin with group or individual silence, which may last for hours and followed by behaviors such as distinctive vocalizations; grooming the carcass; solemn visitation and gazing at the carcass by group members; displays; and lamentation-like whimpers or hoo-calls of distress.\nAttention to the dead is not unique to elephants or chimpanzees. Dolphins have been known to stay with recently deceased members of their pod for several days, preventing divers from getting close. However, the reasons for this remain obscure. While scientists can observe their actions, the thought processes that motivate them are beyond current study.\nTahlequah (a.k.a. J35), a female orca, carried the carcass of her newborn infant for 17 days. Whether this was a \"tour of grief\" or merely instinct is debated.\nCrows and other corvids also seem to participate in funeral-like ritualistic behavior, including gathering around and holding vigils over the carcass.\n",

        "doc": "Gaia philosophy (named after Gaia, Greek goddess of the Earth) is a broadly inclusive term for relating concepts about, humanity as an effect of the life of this planet.\nThe Gaia hypothesis holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the biosphere in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concepts draw a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its evolutionary course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species. While there were a number of precursors to Gaia hypothesis, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of biological homeostasis, and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. Gaia hypothesis criticism]]). These theories are, however, significant in green politics.\nThere are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis.  Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of shamanism).Isaac Newton wrote of the earth, \"Thus this Earth resembles a great animal or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in æthereall breath for its dayly refreshment & vitall ferment & transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age & perishing.\"\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin, a paleontologist and geologist, believed that evolution fractally unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective.  Teilhard later influenced Thomas Berry and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.\nLewis Thomas believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from Johannes Kepler's view of Earth as a single round organism.\nBuckminster Fuller is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century.  Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the Dymaxion map of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.\nIn 1931, L.G.M. Baas Becking delivered an inaugural lecture about Gaia in the sense of life and earth. \nOberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1970 in an article in Green Egg Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis.\nMany believe that these ideas cannot be considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions.  As the above claims are not currently testable, they are outside the bounds of current science. This does not mean that these ideas are not theoretically testable. As one can postulate tests that could be applied, given enough time and space, then these ideas should be seen as scientific hypotheses.\nThese are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for theology, or thealogy as Zell-Ravenheart and Isaac Bonewits put it.\nAccording to James Kirchner there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life.  Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct. An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the coevolving diversity of living organisms.The most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an emergent property of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth's biosphere is consciously manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of homeostasis. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control.\nThe more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.\nBuckminster Fuller has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his Dymaxion map of the Earth.The first scientifically rigorous theory was the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist.\nA variant of this hypothesis was developed by Lynn Margulis, a microbiologist, in 1979.\nHer version is sometimes called the \"Gaia Theory\" (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.\nWhether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist, but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth's overall climate is largely not known.\nThe Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth's ecosystem is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected emergent property of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.\nDepending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream neo-Darwinism. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.\nA very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth's biosphere is consciously manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.\nA social science view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a keystone species who may be able to accomplish global homeostasis. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from 'organic' views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated in various societal settings by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers. As Marshall explains, most social scientists had already given up on systems ideas of society in the 1960s before Gaia philosophy was born under James Lovelock's ideas since such ideas were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism. Gaia theory also influenced the dynamics of green politics.Rosemary Radford Ruether, the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing.A book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the Dalai Lama, Gary Snyder, Thich Nhat Hanh, Allen Ginsberg, David Abram, Joanna Macy, Robert Aitken, and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.\nGaianism, an earth-centered philosophical, holistic, and spiritual belief that shares expressions with earth religions and paganism while not identifying exclusively with any specific religion, sprang from the gaia hypothesis.\n",

El Tío is believed to rule over the mines, simultaneously offering protection and destruction. Some figures are in the shape of a goat.\nMiners bring offerings such as cigarettes, coca leaves, and alcohol for the statues and believe that if El Tío is not fed, he will take matters into his own hands. Villagers of Potosi ritually slaughter a llama and smear its blood on the entrance to the mines.\nThe miners of Cerro Rico are Catholics and they believe in both Christ and El Tío. However, worship of El Tío is condemned strongly by the Catholic Church. Images of El Tío are usually not allowed outside of the mines, as this is seen as the realm of God and El Tío has no place there. Likewise, Christian symbolism is not allowed inside the mines, as this \"Underworld\" is seen as El Tío's realm.\nEvery year, the Carnaval de Oruro is held, and costumes and statues of El Tío are paraded around in a ceremony that represents his defeat at the hands of the Archangel Michael. This is the only time that images of El Tío are allowed above the surface of the mines.\n",

        "doc": "The Night of the Radishes (Spanish: Noche de Rábanos) is an annual event held on December 23 in Oaxaca, Mexico, dedicated to the carving of oversized radishes (Raphanus sativus) to create scenes that compete for prizes in various categories.\nThe event has its origins in the colonial period when radishes were introduced by the Spanish. Oaxaca has a long wood carving tradition and farmers began carving radishes into figures as a way to attract customers' attention at the Christmas market, which was held in the main square on December 23. In 1897, the city instituted the formal competition. As the city has grown, the government has had to dedicate land to the growing of the radishes used for the event, supervising their growth and distribution to competitors. The event has become very popular, attracting over 100 contestants and thousands of visitors. Since the radishes wilt soon after cutting, the works can only be displayed for a number of hours, which has led to very long lines for those wishing to see them. The event also has displays and competitions for works made with corn husks and dried flowers, which are created with the same themes as those with radishes.\nNative to China, radishes were introduced to Mexico by the Spanish, particularly by the friars. Over time, the crop became used as a side dish or snack, or carved into decorations for special dishes. In the colonial period, the radishes began to be carved with religious themes in relation to the annual Christmas market held in the city of Oaxaca on December 23, with the encouragement of priests. The carvings were a marketing gimmick, with farmers using them to attract the attention of shoppers in the market in the city plaza. Eventually people began buying the radishes not only to eat, but to create centerpieces for Christmas dinners.The legend as to how the event began says that one year in the mid-18th century, the radish crop was so abundant that a section lay unharvested for months. In December, two friars pulled up some of these forgotten radishes. The sizes and shapes were amusing, and they brought them as curiosities to the Christmas market held on  December 23. The misshapen vegetables attracted attention and soon they began to be carved to give them a wider variety of shapes and figures.\nIn 1897, the mayor of the city, Francisco Vasconcelos, decided to create a formal radish-carving competition, which has been held each year since.\nOver the years various types of radishes have been used both in Oaxacan cuisine and for carving. A large completely white type called criollo was used earlier, as it did not rot as readily and adopted more capricious forms. While this variety has since disappeared, an image of them can be seen in a work by Diego Rivera called \"Las tentaciones de San Antonio\".\nThe formal Noche de Rábanos competition focuses on the carving of radishes, which can be embellished with other elements. Most entries are scenes that use multiple radishes, with the most traditional being nativity scenes. However, over the 100+ years that the competition has been held, there has been significant diversification in the entries. Common scenes are related to life in Oaxaca such as the Guelaguetza, posadas, calendas (a kind of traditional party), Day of the Dead, Danza de la Pluma, Pineapple Harvest Dance and the Chilena from the Costa Chica, Oaxacan history and folklore as well as the veneration of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Juquila and Our Lady of Solitude, the patron of the state. However, they can also depict other themes such as non-Christmas Biblical stories and can even be in protest. The most common elements are the people, animals, food and handcrafts of the state, but they can also include duendes, snowmen, monsters and more.Originally the radishes used by competitors were those raised by local farmers, but as the city has grown, taking over land traditionally dedicated to their cultivation, the municipal government has stepped in. It has allocated an area near El Tequio Park to their cultivation, specially grown for the event. They are heavily fertilized, chemically treated and left in the ground long after normal harvests to allow them to reach monumental sizes and capricious shapes, which also makes them unsuitable for human consumption. The resulting vegetables can be up to fifty centimeters in length, ten centimeters or wider and can weigh up to three kilos. In 2014, twelve tons of radishes were harvested for that event alone. Local authorities monitor the harvest and distribute the crop to registered contestants on December 18. The radish currently used has a red skin and a white interior. The use of this radish, which is softer than other varieties, has precipitated a number of strategies different from those used in the past, one being the use of the contrast between the skin and the interior and the other to peel and flatten the red skin for use as clothing items, flags and more. Typically participants use knives and toothpicks to create the sculptures, after the tops of the radishes with their long, green leaves have been cut off (and sometimes used in the scenes) . Although the carving of radishes evolved from the area's tradition of wood carving, the current competition does not attract current woodcarvers as the material is very different.\nThe event attracts over 100 participants from the city of Oaxaca and neighboring communities, especially San Antonino Velazco. In 2014, 94 competed in the adult categories, along with 61 youth and 50 children. Contestants register months in advance and from the 18th to the 23rd they must plan and design their scenes, generally using the natural shapes of the radishes they have been allotted as a guide. The actual carving and assembly of the entries occurs during the day of December 23. There are several categories of participation. For adults, radish sculptures and scenes can be in the traditional or \"free\" category, which is determined by the theme. Works in the traditional category are for depictions of nativity scenes and those of Oaxacan traditions. Those in the free category generally depict more contemporary themes. However, as the function of the event is to preserve tradition, the grand prize of 15,000 pesos is awarded to the winner of the traditional category. In 2014 the grand prize winner was the entry \"Dulces Regionales Oaxaqueños\" by the Vasquez Lopez family. There are also prizes for participants competing as novices, and a children's category for those aged from six to seventeen to encourage new generations to continue the tradition. Prizes for the children's categories include bicycles and school supplies. The event has also added categories for scenes made not from radishes but instead from dried corn husks (called totomoxtle) and those made with a dried flower called \"flor inmortal\" (immortal flower) named such as it dries quickly and keeps most of its color. These entries also have several subcategories and generally have similar themes to those done with radishes.\nSince the radishes do not keep after they are cut and quickly wilt, the entire event lasts only for a number of hours from the late afternoon to early evening of December 23, with stands set up the morning before around the main square of the city and taken down the morning after. Visitors are permitted to pass by the stands starting in the late afternoon, with judging and the awarding of prizes taking place at about 9 pm, with the radish sculptures removed shortly after that. The event has become popular, attracting thousands of visitors as well as functionaries that can include the state's governor. Despite the creation of a two-line system (the one behind on a raised platform) for visitors to file by the stands, wait times can be as long as 4:5 hours to see the entries.\n",

        "title": "Wilderness-acquired_diarrhea",
        "doc": "Wilderness-acquired diarrhea is a variety of traveler's diarrhea in which backpackers and other outdoor enthusiasts are affected. Potential sources are contaminated food or water, or \"hand-to-mouth\", directly from another person who is infected. Cases generally resolve spontaneously, with or without treatment, and the cause is typically unknown. The National Outdoor Leadership School has recorded about one incident per 5,000 person-field days by following strict protocols on hygiene and water treatment.  More limited, separate studies have presented highly varied estimated rates of affliction that range from 3 percent to 74 percent of wilderness visitors.  One survey found that long-distance Appalachian Trail hikers reported diarrhea as their most common illness. Based on reviews of epidemiologic data and literature, some researchers believe that the risks have been over-stated and are poorly understood by the public.\nThe average incubation periods for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are each 7 days. Certain other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may take weeks to manifest itself. The onset usually occurs within the first week of return from the field, but may also occur at any time while hiking.Most cases begin abruptly and usually result in increased frequency, volume, and weight of stool. Typically, a hiker experiences at least four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, bloating, low fever, urgency, and malaise, and usually the appetite is affected. The condition is much more serious if there is blood or mucus in stools, abdominal pain, or high fever. Dehydration is a possibility. Life-threatening illness resulting from WAD is extremely rare but can occur in people with weakened immune systems.\nSome people may be carriers and not exhibit symptoms.\nInfectious diarrhea acquired in the wilderness is caused by various bacteria, viruses, and parasites (protozoa). The most commonly reported are the protozoa Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Other infectious agents may play a larger role than generally believed and include Campylobacter, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, enterotoxogenic E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, Shigella, and various other viruses. More rarely, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Cyanobacterium may also cause disease.Giardia lamblia cysts usually do not tolerate freezing although some cysts can survive a single freeze:thaw cycle.  Cysts can remain viable for nearly three months in river water when the temperature is 10 °C and about one month at 15:20 °C in lake water. Cryptosporidium may survive in cold waters (4 °C) for up to 18 months, and can even withstand freezing, although its viability is thereby greatly reduced. Many other varieties of diarrhea-causing organisms, including Shigella and Salmonella typhi, and hepatitis A virus, can survive freezing for weeks to months. Virologists believe all surface water in the United States and Canada has the potential to contain human viruses, which cause a wide range of illnesses including diarrhea, polio and meningitis. Modes of acquiring infection from these causes are limited to fecal-oral transmission, and contaminated water and food. The major factor governing pathogen content of surface water is human and animal activity in the watershed.\nIt may be difficult to associate a particular case of diarrhea with a recent wilderness trip of a few days because incubation of the disease may outlast the trip. Studies of trips that are much longer than the average incubation period, e.g. a week for Cryptosporidium and Giardia, are less susceptible to these errors since there is enough time for the diarrhea to occur during the trip. Other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may require weeks.A suspected case of wilderness-acquired diarrhea may be assessed within the general context of intestinal complaints. During any given four-week period, as many as 7.2% of Americans may experience some form of infectious or non-infectious diarrhea. There are an estimated 99 million annual cases of intestinal infectious disease in the United States, most commonly from viruses, followed by bacteria and parasites, including Giardia and Cryptosporidium. There are an estimated 1.2 million U.S. cases of symptomatic giardiasis annually. However, only about 40% of cases are symptomatic.\nSince wilderness acquired diarrhea can be caused by insufficient hygiene, contaminated water, and (possibly) increased susceptibility from vitamin deficiency, prevention methods should address these causes.The risk of fecal-oral transmission of pathogens that cause diarrhea can be significantly reduced by good hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water after urination and defecation, and washing eating utensils with warm soapy water. Additionally a three-bowl system can be used for washing eating utensils.Water can be treated in the wilderness through filtering, chemical disinfectants, a portable ultraviolet light device, pasteurizing or boiling. Factors in choice may include the number of people involved, space and weight considerations, the quality of available water, personal taste and preferences, and fuel availability.In a study of long-distance backpacking, it was found that water filters were used more consistently than chemical disinfectants. Inconsistent use of iodine or chlorine may be due to disagreeable taste, extended treatment time or treatment complexity due to water temperature and turbidity.\nBecause methods based on halogens, such as iodine and chlorine, do not kill Cryptosporidium, and because filtration misses some viruses, the best protection may require a two-step process of either filtration or coagulation-flocculation, followed by halogenation. Boiling is effective in all situations.\nIodine resins, if combined with microfiltration to remove resistant cysts, are also a viable single-step process, but may not be effective under all conditions. New one-step techniques using chlorine dioxide, ozone, and UV radiation may prove effective, but still require validation.\nUltraviolet (UV) light for water disinfection is well established and widely used for large applications, like municipal water systems. Some hikers use small portable UV devices which meet the U.S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers, for example, the SteriPEN. Another approach to portable UV water purification is solar disinfection (also called sodis). Clear water is sterilized by putting it in a clear polyethylene (PET) bottle and leaving it in direct sunlight for 6 hours.\nDifferent types of water sources may have different levels of contamination:More contamination may be in water that\nlikely could have passed through an area subject to heavy human or animal use\nis cloudy, has surface foam, or has some other suspicious appearance.\nLess contamination may be in water from\nsprings (provided the true source is not surface water a short distance above)\nlarge streams (those entering from the side may have less contamination than those paralleling the trail)\nfast-flowing streams\nhigher elevations\nlakes with undisturbed sediments (10 days undisturbed water storage can result in 75:99% removal of coliform bacteria by settling to the bottom)\nfreshly melted snow\ndeep wells (provided they aren't subject to contamination from surface runoff)\nregions where there was a heavy snow year when streams run full and long compared to dry years.\nRain storms can either improve or worsen water quality. They can wash contaminants into water and stir up contaminated sediments with increasing flow, but can also dilute contaminants by adding large amounts of water.\nUnfortunately, there have not been any epidemiological studies to validate the above, except possibly for the case of spring water.\nOne study suggests that on very long trips in the wilderness, taking multivitamins may reduce the incidence of diarrhea.WAD is typically self-limited, generally resolving without specific treatment. Oral rehydration therapy with rehydration salts is often beneficial to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Clear, disinfected water or other liquids are routinely recommended.Hikers who develop three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period : especially if associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or blood in stools : should be treated by a doctor and may benefit from antibiotics, usually given for 3:5 days. Alternatively, a single dose azithromycin or levofloxacin may be prescribed. If diarrhea persists despite therapy, travelers should be evaluated and treated for possible parasitic infection.\nCryptosporidium can be quite dangerous to patients with compromised immune systems. Alinia (nitazoxanide) is approved by the FDA for treatment of Cryptosporidium.\nThe risk of acquiring infectious diarrhea in the wilderness arises from inadvertent ingestion of pathogens. Various studies have sought to estimate diarrhea attack rates among wilderness travelers, and results have ranged widely. The variation of diarrhea rate between studies may depend on the time of year, the location of the study, the length of time the hikers were in the wilderness,the prevention methods used, and the study methodology.\nThe National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), which emphasizes strict hand-washing techniques, water disinfection and washing of common cooking utensils in their programs, reports that gastrointestinal illnesses occurred at a rate of only 0.26 per 1000 program days. In contrast, a  survey of long-distance Appalachian Trail  hikers found more than half  the respondents reported at least one episode of diarrhea that lasted an average of two days. (Infectious diarrhea may last longer than an average of two days; certain forms of non-infectious diarrhea, caused by diet change etc., can be of very brief duration).  Analysis of this survey found occurrence of diarrhea was positively associated with the duration of exposure in the wilderness. During any given four-week period, as many as 7.2% of Americans may experience some form of infectious or non-infectious diarrhea. A number of behaviors each individually reduced the incidence of diarrhea: treating water; routinely washing hands with soap and water after defecation and urination; cleaning cooking utensils with soap and warm water; and taking multi-vitamins.\nA variety of pathogens can cause infectious diarrhea, and most cases among backpackers appear to be caused by bacteria from feces. A study at Grand Teton National Park found 69% of diarrhea affected visitors had no identifiable cause, that 23% had diarrhea due to Campylobacter and 8% of patients with diarrhea had giardiasis. Campylobacter enteritis occurred most frequently in young adults who had hiked in wilderness areas and drunk untreated surface water in the week prior. Another study tested 35 individuals before and after a trip to the Desolation Wilderness of California. Giardia cysts were found in fecal samples from two people after the trip, but they were asymptomatic. A third person was empirically treated for symptoms of giardiasis.\nFecal-oral transmission may be the most common vector for wilderness acquired diarrhea. There are differing opinions regarding the importance of routine disinfection of water during relatively brief backcountry visits.\nInfection by fecal coliform bacteria, which indicate fecal pollution, are more common than giardiasis. Risks are highest in surface water near trails used by pack animals and cattle pastures.Most samples of backcountry water in the Desolation Wilderness in California have found very low or no Giardia cysts. The infectious dose of giardia, however, is very low, with about 2% chance of infection from a single cyst. Also, very few studies have addressed the issue of transient contamination. According to one researcher, the likely model for the risk of Giardia from wilderness water is pulse contamination, that is, a brief period of high cyst concentration from fecal contamination.\nDiarrhea acquired in the wilderness or other remote areas is typically a form of infectious diarrhea, itself classified as a type of secretory diarrhea. These are all considered forms of gastroenteritis. The term may be applied in various remote areas of non-tropical developed countries (U.S., Canada, western Europe, etc.), but is less applicable in developing countries, and in the tropics, because of the different pathogens that are most likely to cause infection.",

        "doc": "Irreecha (also called Irreessa or Dhibaayyuu), is thanksgiving holiday celebrating the end of the winter in Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Irreecha is the most celebrated cultural festival in Africa. The Oromo people celebrate Irreecha to thank Waaqa (God) for the blessings and mercies they have received throughout the previous year. The Irreecha festival is celebrated every year at the beginning of Birraa (Spring), new season after the dark and rainy winter season. It is attended by hundreds of thousands people. The thanksgiving is celebrated at sacred lakes across Oromia Region like the Hora Finfinne and Hora Harsadi, Bishoftu, Oromia Region as a whole. Once at the lake, festival-goers immerse freshly cut  green grass and the flowers they are carrying and sprinkle themselves and place in water.\nIn 2019, the festival was celebrated in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia and the regional state of Oromia, followed by Irreecha in Bishoftu. The 2020 Irreecha in Addis Ababa was celebrated by around 5,000 people due to political tension and the COVID-19 pandemic. Irreecha is also celebrated around the world where diaspora Oromos live especially in North America and Europe.\nMany people interpreted the Irrecha festival of the Oromo people as a festival of difficulty period between the month of June and September. But the reality is not as many have exaggerated today. The Irrecha festival is a celebration to welcome the expected seeds and fruits of prosperity, and peace. The Oromo people also consider the winter rainy season of June to September as a time of difficulty in communication with families and friends due to heavy rains which could cause rivers to swell and floods that may drown people, cattle, crop, and flood homes. Also, family relationships will suffer during winter rain as they can not visit each other because of swelling rivers. In addition, winter time could be a time of hunger for some because the previous harvest collected in January is running short and the new harvest is not ripe yet. Because of this, some families may endure food shortages during the winter. In Birraa (Spring in Oromoland), this shortage ends as many food crops especially maize is ripe and families can eat their fill. Other crops like potato, barley, etc. will also be ripe in Birraa. Some disease types like malaria also break out during rainy winter time. Because of this, the Oromos see winter as a difficult season. It does not mean the Oromo people hate rain or the winter season at all. Even when there is a shortage of rain, they pray to Waaqa (God) for rain.The Oromo people celebrate Irreecha not only to thank Waaqa (God) but also to welcome the new season of plentiful harvests after the dark and rainy winter season associated with nature and creatures. At Irreecha festivals, friends, family, and relatives gather together and celebrate with joy and happiness. Irreecha festivals bring people closer to each other and make social bonds.\nMoreover, the Oromo people celebrate this auspicious event to mark the end of the rainy season, known as Ganna, which was established by Oromo forefathers, in the time of Gadaa Melbaa in Mormor, Oromia. The auspicious day on which this last Mormor Day of Gadaa Melbaa - the Dark Time of starvation and hunger- was established on the Sunday of last week of September or the Sunday of the 1st week of October according to the Gadaa lunar calendar has been designated as National Thanksgiving Day by modern-day Oromo people.\nOn 2 October 2016, between 55 and 300 festival goers were killed in a stampede at the Irreecha cultural thanksgiving festival, which was the largest and most sacred cultural festival for the Oromo people. In just one day, dozens were killed and many more were injured during the stampede. Locals blamed security forces for triggering the stampede.",

        "doc": "The Dairy in the New Garden (Alte Meierei) is a historic building located in Potsdam, Germany. It is situated on the shore of the Jungfernsee lake, at the northernmost tip of the New Garden. The Dairy was constructed between 1790 and 1792 under the supervision of master builder Carl Gotthard Langhans, with Andreas Ludwig Krüger carrying out the construction.\nIn the course of laying out the landscape garden and building the Marble Palace under Frederick William II of Prussia, a dairy was built to supply the royal court. Cows grazing on the surrounding land produced milk for the manufacture of butter and cheese.In 1843/1844 Frederick William IV. had the building extended. To a design by the architect Ludwig Persius a second storey was added under the direction of Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse and the southwest corner was enhanced with a tower. Battlements run along the edges of the roof and gave the building a Norman character.\nA second expansion was carried out in 1857 with the engine or pump house, which was built to water the New Garden. The high, slender chimney is part of that technical modification. The upper basin for the supply of water is nowadays located within the Belvedere on the Pfingstberg.\nIn 1928 a restaurant was established in the building that became one of the most popular destinations for day trippers in Potsdam until the Second World War.\nIts occupation by the Red Army at the end of 1945 and the destruction by fire of part of the building ended its gastronomic function. The dairy was still in this ruined condition when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961.\nIn 1991, after the Wende, renovation and restoration measures were carried out on the old building and, in 2003, it was able to re-open as a brewery and restaurant (Gasthausbrauerei).\n",

        "title": "Pagophagia",
        "doc": "Pagophagia (from Greek: pagos, frost/ice, + phagō, to eat) is the compulsive consumption of ice or iced drinks. It is a form of the disorder known as pica, which in Latin refers to a magpie that eats everything indiscriminately. Pica's medical definition refers to the persistent consumption of nonnutritive substances, ice in this case, for over a period of at least one month. However, different studies have included alternative definitions for pagophagia, including \"daily consumption of 2:11 full glasses of ice (480:2640 g)\" or \"the purposeful ingestion of at least one ordinary tray of ice daily for a period in excess of two months.\" It has been shown to be associated with iron-deficiency anemia and responsive to iron supplementation, leading some investigators to postulate that some forms of pica may be the result of nutritional deficiency.\nSimilarly, folk wisdom also maintained that pica reflected an appetite to compensate for nutritional deficiencies, such as low iron or zinc. In iron deficient pregnant women who experience symptoms of pagophagia, decreased cravings for ice have been observed after iron supplementation. Later research demonstrated that the substances ingested by those who have pica generally do not provide the mineral or nutrient in which people are deficient. In the long run, as people start consuming more nonfoods compulsively, pica can also cause additional nutritional deficiencies.\nA hypothesis of the neurological basis of pagophagia was proposed in a 2014 study in which those with iron deficiency anemia were shown to have improved response times while performing on a neuropsychological test when given ice to chew on. As a result, the researchers hypothesized that chewing on ice causes vascular changes that allow for increased perfusion of the brain, as well as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which also increases blood flow to the brain, allowing for increased processing speed and alertness.\nAlthough some investigators also hypothesize that chewing ice may lessen pain in glossitis and stomatitis related to iron-deficiency anemia, the specific pathophysiology is still unknown and this hypothesis remains controversial. The American Dental Association recommends not chewing ice as it can lead to dental injury and suggests that ice should be allowed to melt in the mouth instead.\nThe main symptom for pagophagia is intense cravings for chewing ice. Those with pagophagia will find themselves constantly chewing on ice cubes, shaved ice or even frost from the fridge. Since a common underlying cause of pagophagia is iron-deficiency anemia, many people with the disorder will also experience weakness, fatigue, pallor, sore tongue, dizziness, headache, and cold extremities. Other symptoms associated with iron deficiency may include brittle nails, cracking at the corner of the mouth, and restless legs syndrome. Severe cases of iron deficiency can also cause the body to make up for decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood by increasing cardiac output. Thus, palpitations, angina, as well as shortness of breath may also present, specially if there is a preexisting cardiovascular disease or condition. Excess water intake from any source can lead to hyponatremia and has been noted in at least one case study.Although compulsive consumption of ice is frequently associated with a deficiency of iron, the exact etiology of this form of pica is not well-understood. There is one hypothesis that states consumption of ice activates a vasoconstrictive response which causes an increase of blood flow to the brain. Because fatigue is the most common symptom experienced in iron-deficiency anemia due to decreased levels of oxygen delivered to the brain, the increase of blood flow to the brain through consumption of ice is thought to increase alertness and improve the symptoms of fatigue. In support of this hypothesis, individuals with iron-deficient anemia were found to have improved response times on neuropsychological tests than compared to healthy controls when chewing ice.Reports have demonstrated the improvement or resolution of pagophagia when given iron supplementation. People with iron-deficiency anemia who showed symptoms of pagophagia had complete resolution of their symptoms when their iron levels were treated, suggesting the association between serum iron levels and symptoms of pagophagia. In another case, an individual who presented with pagophagia was prescribed 325mg tablets of ferrous sulfate twice daily. The individual was also administered 1000mg of low molecular weight dextran over 1 hour and their symptoms of pagophagia were immediately resolved. In another case, a woman with iron-deficiency anemia related to gynecological bleeding was admitted and her dietary screening showed consumption of about 80 ice cubes for day for the past 5 years. She was given iron supplementation and her anemia was treated along with the disappearance of pagophagia within two weeks.\nOne study looked at the relationship between pagophagia and H. pylori infection in those with iron deficiency anemia. It was found that pagophagia does not increase the risk of H. pylori infections in that specific population. In addition, H. pylori infection and pagophagia did not have a synergistic effect on the development of iron absorption abnormalities in the intestines.\nPagophagia has been often reported with calcium deficiency but its pathophysiology is unknown.In several cases, pagophagia has been associated with certain psychological conditions such as compulsive behavior or depressive disorder where pagophagia was used as a coping mechanism to deal with psychological stress. Some suggestions for other causes of pagophagia include hunger and gastrointestinal distress related to ways the body attempts to ease the stress.Other known risk factors for pica include \"stress, cultural factors, learned behavior, low socioeconomic status, underlying mental health disorder, nutritional deficiency, child neglect, pregnancy, epilepsy, [and] familial psychopathology.\"\nIn one case report, a 42-year-old woman presented with complaints of freezer frost and eating ice. She developed a habit of eating 10 to 12 ice cubes and freezer frost each day, and eventually increased her consumption to 25 to 30 ice cubes each day. Her medical assessment revealed no past or family history of any chronic psychiatric disorder or physical disorder. Her hemoglobin, serum calcium, and stool examination were normal. One suspected cause of her pagophagia was psychological stress, the stressor being her son's annual examinations. The woman was previously prescribed venlafaxine 50mg and vitamin B-complex for two to six weeks but with no improvement. The doctor initiated fluoxetine 20mg daily for her and the venlafaxine was tapered off. The dose was increased to 30mg after three weeks and counseling and behavioral treatment was given. Her pagophagia resolved after four months. Along with this case, previous reports have shown selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors effective in treating pagophagia. Counseling and behavioral strategies such as positive and negative reinforcement should be utilized for people with psychiatric conditions.\nPagophagia may often go undiagnosed as those with the condition may consider it to be harmless and not seek medical help unless the behavior begins to interfere with their lives. However, the disorder is not as harmless as it seems since underlying medical causes that remain undiagnosed may lead to complications. For example, if anemia is not treated properly, the heart will need to exert more force in order to supply adequate oxygen throughout the body which can progress to heart failure. Other complications of pagophagia include tooth sensitivity and dental injury leading to cracked or chipped teeth. Overconsumption of ice may cause bloating, gas, and stomach pain. Imaging exams such as abdominal x-rays and endoscopy may be ordered if a person presents with abdominal symptoms. Due to the relation between pagophagia and iron deficiency anemia, diagnosis begins with obtaining a medical history, a physical exam as well as blood tests that includes a complete blood count and additional tests to determine levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum iron, and ferritin, a protein that helps the body store iron. In individuals that are anemic, the tests would show results with lower than normal levels which would then confirm the diagnosis. If a blood slide is ordered by the doctor, it may show red blood cells that are smaller and paler than normal cells. In the case of severe iron deficiency, white blood cell count may also be low.\nA differential diagnosis for psychiatric conditions should be performed in the setting of pagophagia. Schizophrenia and psychosis, other eating disorders, substance use, and autism should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\nWhen screening for suspected pagophagia, it may be appropriate to include screening for iron deficiency. Screening for pagophagia may help clinicians gather valuable information towards the diagnosis and treatment, especially populations who are at risk, for iron deficiency. Women who are menstruating, pregnant, or lactating may benefit from pagophagia screening because of the high occurrence of iron deficiency in these groups. Other groups at risk due to prevalence of iron deficiency include blood donors, individuals who are post-surgery or trauma, or people who experience malabsorption of iron. Collecting information during health screening to determine any causes of blood loss, malabsorption of iron from the diet, and any laboratory tests to determine iron deficiency may be appropriate in people who present with symptoms of pagophagia. If iron deficiency is confirmed by laboratory screening, iron replacement therapy can be considered with oral supplementation. Over the counter or prescription formulations of iron containing ferrous gluconate, ferrous sulfate, or ferrous fumarate are available.In one study of pica in iron deficient versus iron replete blood donors, \"pica was reported in 11% of donors with iron depletion/deficiency, compared with 4% of iron-replete donors,\" with pagophagia accounting for 94% of reported pica cases. A case series of pagophagia in men with iron-deficiency anemia concluded \"that pagophagia occurred in 34% of men with iron-deficiency anemia.\" Men who were older and had higher platelet counts were less likely to have pagophagia compared to younger men and those with lower platelet counts.In women, pica is \"most often seen during pregnancy,\" with estimates of 27.8% of pregnant women experiencing pica, but pica prevalence and manifestation is culturally and geographically heterogenous. A study of pregnant women in Tehran, Iran found pica in 8.33% of the study population with pagophagia accounting for 76% of observed pica cases. Logistic regression showed a positive correlation between pica in pregnancy with pregnancy complications, lower educational attainment, and use of iron supplementation. A study of pica in pregnant Mexican-born women living in either the United States or Mexico found differing rates of pagophagy between the two groups.A meta-analysis of the prevalence of pica in German children found that 12.3% of German children \"have engaged with a pica behavior at some point in their lives,\" but did not specify the types of pica observed. Despite pica being observed in young children, it is important to note that it is also a common eating disorder among those who are intellectually impaired. Thus, proper diagnosis of pica is essential, requiring the children to be at least above two years of age, as it is more common to see children younger than two consuming nonnutritive substances. In children, pica is usually short term and will disappear spontaneously. In terms of studies regarding a specific type of pica, a cross-sectional study of American children receiving chronic hemodialysis therapy found that 34.5% of the children studied engaged in pagophagy compared to 12.6% of children who engaged in other forms of pica.",

        "title": "Liquor",
        "doc": "Liquor or distilled beverages are alcoholic drinks produced by the distillation of grains, fruits, vegetables, or sugar that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. Other terms for liquor include spirit, spirituous liquor or hard liquor. While the word liquor ordinarily refers to distilled alcoholic spirits rather than beverages produced by fermentation alone, it can sometimes be used more broadly to refer to any alcoholic beverage (or even non-alcoholic products of distillation or various other liquids).\nThe distillation process concentrates the liquid to increase its alcohol by volume. As liquors contain significantly more alcohol (ethanol) than other alcoholic drinks, they are considered \"harder\". In North America, the term hard liquor is sometimes used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones, whereas the term spirits is more commonly used in the United Kingdom. Some examples of liquors include vodka, rum, gin and tequila. Liquors are often aged in barrels, such as for the production of brandy and whiskey, or are infused with flavorings to form flavored liquors, such as absinthe.\nLike other alcoholic drinks, liquor is typically consumed for the psychoactive effects of alcohol. Liquor may be consumed on its own (i.e. \"neat\"), typically in amounts of around 50 millilitres (1.7 US fluid ounces) per served drink; or frequently mixed with other ingredients to form a cocktail. In an undiluted form, distilled beverages are often slightly sweet and bitter and typically impart a burning mouthfeel with an odor derived from the alcohol and the production and aging processes; the exact flavor varies between different varieties of liquor and the different impurities they impart.\nRapid consumption of a large amount of liquor can cause severe alcohol intoxication or alcohol poisoning, which can be fatal either due to acute biochemical damage to vital organs (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis), or due to trauma (e.g. falls or motor vehicle accidents) caused by alcohol-induced delirium. Consistent consumption of liquor over time correlates with higher mortality and other harmful health effects, even when compared to other alcoholic beverages.\nThe term \"spirit\" (singular and used without the additional term \"drink\") refers to liquor that should not contain added sugar and is usually 35:40% alcohol by volume (ABV). Fruit brandy, for example, is also known as 'fruit spirit'.Liquor bottled with added sugar and flavorings, such as Grand Marnier, amaretto, and American schnapps, are known instead as liqueurs.\nLiquor generally has an alcohol concentration higher than 30% when bottled, and before being diluted for bottling, it typically has a concentration over 50%. Beer and wine, which are not distilled, typically have a maximum alcohol content of about 15% ABV, as most yeasts cannot metabolize when the concentration of alcohol is above this level; as a consequence, fermentation ceases at that point.\nThe origin of liquor and its close relative liquid is the Latin verb liquere, meaning 'to be fluid'. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), an early use of the word in the English language, meaning simply \"a liquid\", can be dated to 1225. The first use documented in the OED defined as \"a liquid for drinking\" occurred in the 14th century. Its use as a term for \"an intoxicating alcoholic drink\" appeared in the 16th century.In accordance with the regulation (EU) 2019/787 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 17, 2019, a spirit drink is an alcoholic beverage that has been produced:either directly by using, individually or in combination, any of the following methods:\ndistillation, with or without added flavourings or flavouring foodstuffs, of fermented products;\nmaceration or similar processing of plant materials in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, distillates of agricultural origin or spirit drinks or a combination thereof;\naddition, individually or in combination, to ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, distillates of agricultural origin, or spirit drinks of flavourings, colours, other authorised ingredients, sweetening products, other agricultural products, and foodstuffs.\nor by adding, individually or in combination, to it any of the following:\nother spirit drinks;\nethyl alcohol of agricultural origin;\ndistillates of agricultural origin;\nother foodstuffs.\nSpirit drinks must contain at least 15% ABV (except in the case of egg liqueur such as Advocaat, which must contain a minimum of 14% ABV).\nRegulation makes a difference between \"ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin\" and a \"distillate of agricultural origin\". Distillate of agricultural origin is defined as an alcoholic liquid that is the result of the distillation, after alcoholic fermentation, of agricultural products which does not have the properties of ethyl alcohol and which retain the aroma and taste of the raw materials used.Annex 1 to the regulation lists 44 categories of spirit drinks and their legal requirements.Some spirit drinks can fall into more than one category. Specific production requirements distinguish one category from another (London gin falls into the Gin category but any gin cannot be considered as London gin).\nSpirit drinks that are not produced within the EU, such as tequila or baijiu, are not listed in the 44 categories.\nEarly evidence of distillation comes from Akkadian tablets dated c. 1200 BC describing perfumery operations, providing textual evidence that an early, primitive form of distillation was known to the Babylonians of ancient Mesopotamia. Early evidence of distillation also comes from alchemists working in Alexandria, Roman Egypt, in the 1st century. Distilled water was described in the 2nd century AD by Alexander of Aphrodisias. Alchemists in Roman Egypt were using a distillation alembic or still device in the 3rd century.Distillation was known in the ancient Indian subcontinent, evident from baked clay retorts and receivers found at Taxila and Charsadda in Pakistan and Rang Mahal in India dating to the early centuries of the Common Era. Frank Raymond Allchin says these terracotta distill tubes were \"made to imitate bamboo\". These \"Gandhara stills\" were capable of producing only very weak liquor, as there was no efficient means of collecting the vapors at low heat.\nDistillation in China could have begun during the Eastern Han dynasty (1st:2nd centuries), but the distillation of beverages began in the Jin (12th:13th centuries) and Southern Song (10th:13th centuries) dynasties according to archaeological evidence.\nFreeze distillation involves freezing the alcoholic beverage and then removing the ice. The freezing technique had limitations in geography and implementation limiting how widely this method was put to use.\nThe flammable nature of the exhalations of wine was already known to ancient natural philosophers such as Aristotle (384:322 BCE), Theophrastus (c. 371 : c. 287 BCE), and Pliny the Elder (23/24:79 CE). This did not immediately lead to the isolation of alcohol, however,  despite the development of more advanced distillation techniques in second- and third-century Roman Egypt. An important recognition, first found in one of the writings attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (ninth century CE), was that by adding salt to boiling wine, which increases the wine's relative volatility, the flammability of the resulting vapors may be enhanced. The distillation of wine is attested in Arabic works attributed to al-Kindī (c. 801:873 CE) and to al-Fārābī (c. 872:950), and in the 28th book of al-Zahrāwī's (Latin: Abulcasis, 936:1013) Kitāb al-Taṣrīf (later translated into Latin as Liber servatoris). In the twelfth century, recipes for the production of aqua ardens (\"burning water\", i.e., alcohol) by distilling wine with salt started to appear in a number of Latin works, and by the end of the thirteenth century, it had become a widely known substance among Western European chemists. Its medicinal properties were studied by Arnald of Villanova (1240:1311 CE) and John of Rupescissa (c. 1310:1366), the latter of whom regarded it as a life-preserving substance able to prevent all diseases (the aqua vitae or \"water of life\", also called by John the quintessence of wine).In China, archaeological evidence indicates that the true distillation of alcohol began during the 12th century Jin or Southern Song dynasties.\nA still has been found at an archaeological site in Qinglong, Hebei, dating to the 12th century.\nIn India, the true distillation of alcohol was introduced from the Middle East and was in wide use in the Delhi Sultanate by the 14th century.\nThe works of Taddeo Alderotti (1223:1296) describe a method for concentrating alcohol involving repeated fractional distillation through a water-cooled still, by which an alcohol purity of 90% could be obtained.\nIn 1437, \"burned water\" (brandy) was mentioned in the records of the County of Katzenelnbogen in Germany.\nIt is legal to distill beverage alcohol as a hobby for personal use in some countries, including New Zealand and the Netherlands.In many others including the United States, it is illegal to distill beverage alcohol without a license, and the licensing process is too arduous for hobbyist-scale production. In some parts of the U.S., it is also illegal to sell a still without a license. Nonetheless, all states allow unlicensed individuals to make their own beer, and some also allow unlicensed individuals to make their own wine (although making beer and wine is also prohibited in some local jurisdictions).\nSome countries and sub-national jurisdictions limit or prohibit the sale of certain high-percentage alcohol, commonly known as neutral spirit. Due to its flammability (see below) alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content above 70% by volume are not permitted to be transported in aircraft.Microdistilling (also known as craft distilling) began to re-emerge as a trend in the United States following the microbrewing and craft beer movement in the last decades of the 20th century.The World Health Organization (WHO) measures and publishes alcohol consumption patterns in different countries. The WHO measures alcohol consumed by persons 15 years of age or older and reports it on the basis of liters of pure alcohol consumed per capita in a given year in a country.In Europe, spirits (especially vodka) are more popular in the north and east of the continent.\nDistilled spirits contain ethyl alcohol, the same chemical that is present in beer and wine, and as such, spirit consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the spirits and the timespan over which the consumption took place.The short-term effects of alcohol consumption range from a decrease in anxiety and motor skills and euphoria at lower doses to intoxication (drunkenness), to stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia (memory \"blackouts\"), and central nervous system depression at higher doses. Cell membranes are highly permeable to alcohol, so once it is in the bloodstream, it can diffuse into nearly every cell in the body.  Alcohol can greatly exacerbate sleep problems. During abstinence, residual disruptions in sleep regularity and sleep patterns are the greatest predictors of relapse. \nDrinking more than 1:2 drinks a day increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. The risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking, which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are due to alcohol each year.\nUnlike wine and perhaps beer, there is no evidence for a J-shaped health effect for the consumption of distilled alcohol.  Long-term use can lead to an alcohol use disorder, an increased risk of developing physical dependence. cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer.\nAlcoholism, also known as \"alcohol use disorder\", is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third-leading cause of early death in the United States.\nConsumption of alcohol in any quantity can cause cancer. Alcohol causes breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, and head-and-neck cancers. The more alcohol is consumed, the higher the cancer risk.\nA survey of high school students in Alstahaug, Nordland county, revealed that adolescents consume alcohol at rates above the national average, with home-made liquor being prevalent and easily accessible, highlighting an urgent need for preventive measures.",

        "title": "Custard",
        "doc": "Custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on sweetened milk, cheese, or cream cooked with egg or egg yolk to thicken it, and sometimes also flour, corn starch, or gelatin. Depending on the recipe, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (crème anglaise) to the thick pastry cream (crème pâtissière) used to fill éclairs. The most common custards are used in custard desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla; however, savory custards are also found, e.g., in quiche.\nCustard is usually cooked in a double boiler (bain-marie), or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove, though custard can also be steamed, baked in the oven with or without a water bath, or even cooked in a pressure cooker. Custard preparation is a delicate operation because a temperature increase of 3:6 °C (5.4:10.8 °F) leads to overcooking and curdling. Generally, a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 °C (176 °F); it begins setting at 70 °C (158 °F). A bain marie water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles. Adding a small amount of cornflour to the egg-sugar mixture stabilises the resulting custard, allowing it to be cooked in a single pan as well as in a double-boiler. A sous-vide water bath may be used to precisely control temperature.While custard may refer to a wide variety of thickened dishes, technically (and in French cookery) the word custard (crème or more precisely crème moulée, [kʁɛm mule]) refers only to an egg-thickened custard.When starch is added, the result is called 'pastry cream' (French: crème pâtissière, pronounced [kʁɛm pɑtisjɛːʁ]) or confectioners' custard, made with a combination of milk or cream, egg yolks, fine sugar, flour or some other starch, and usually a flavoring such as vanilla, chocolate, or lemon. Crème pâtissière is a key ingredient in many French desserts, including mille-feuille (or Napoleons) and filled tarts. It is also used in Italian pastry and sometimes in Boston cream pie. The thickening of the custard is caused by the combination of egg and starch. Corn flour or flour thickens at 100 °C (212 °F) and as such many recipes instruct the pastry cream to be boiled. In a traditional custard such as a crème anglaise, where eggs are used alone as a thickener, boiling results in the over-cooking and subsequent curdling of the custard; however, in a pastry cream, starch prevents this. Once cooled, the amount of starch in pastry cream sets the cream and requires it to be beaten or whipped before use.\nWhen gelatin is added, it is known as crème anglaise collée ([kʁɛm ɑ̃ɡlɛz kɔle]). When gelatin is added and whipped cream is folded in, and it sets in a mold, it is bavarois. When starch is used alone as a thickener (without eggs), the result is a blancmange.\nIn the United Kingdom, custard has various traditional recipes some thickened principally with cornflour (cornstarch) rather than the egg component, others involving regular flour; see custard powder.\nAfter the custard has thickened, it may be mixed with other ingredients: mixed with stiffly beaten egg whites and gelatin, it is chiboust cream; mixed with whipped cream, it is crème légère, [kʁɛm leʒɛːʁ]. Beating in softened butter produces German buttercream or crème mousseline.\nA quiche is a savoury custard tart. Some kinds of timbale or vegetable loaf are made of a custard base mixed with chopped savoury ingredients. Custard royale is a thick custard cut into decorative shapes and used to garnish soup, stew or broth. In German, it is known as Eierstich and is used as a garnish in German Wedding Soup (Hochzeitssuppe). Chawanmushi is a Japanese savoury custard, steamed and served in a small bowl or on a saucer. Chinese steamed egg is a similar but larger savoury egg dish. Bougatsa is a Greek breakfast pastry whose sweet version consists of semolina custard filling between layers of phyllo.\nCustard may also be used as a top layer in gratins, such as the South African bobotie and many Balkan versions of moussaka.\nIn Peru, leche asada (\"baked milk\") is custard baked in individual molds. It is considered a restaurant dish.\nFrench cuisine has several named variations on custard:Recipes involving sweet custard are listed in the custard dessert category, and include:Custards baked in pastry (custard tarts) were very popular in the Middle Ages, and are the origin of the English word 'custard': the French term croustade originally referred to the crust of a tart, and is derived from the Italian word crostata, and ultimately the Latin crustāre.Examples include Crustardes of flessh and Crustade, in the 14th century English collection The Forme of Cury. These recipes include solid ingredients such as meat, fish, and fruit bound by the custard. Stirred custards cooked in pots are also found under the names Creme Boylede and Creme boiled. Some custards especially in the Elizabethan era used marigold (calendula) to give the custard color.\nIn modern times, the name 'custard' is sometimes applied to starch-thickened preparations like blancmange and Bird's Custard powder.\nStirred custard is thickened by coagulation of egg protein, while the same gives baked custard its gel structure. The type of milk used also impacts the result. Most important to a successfully stirred custard is to avoid excessive heat that will cause over-coagulation and syneresis that will result in a curdled custard.Eggs contain the proteins necessary for the gel structure to form, and emulsifiers to maintain the structure. Egg yolk also contains enzymes like amylase, which can break down added starch. This enzyme activity contributes to the overall thinning of custard in the mouth. Egg yolk lecithin also helps to maintain the milk-egg interface. The proteins in egg whites are set at 60:80 °C (140:176 °F).\nStarch is sometimes added to custard to prevent premature curdling. The starch acts as a heat buffer in the mixture: as they hydrate, they absorb heat and help maintain a constant rate of heat transfer. Starches also make for a smoother texture and thicker mouth feel.\nIf the mixture pH is 9 or higher, the gel is too hard; if it is below 5, the gel structure has difficulty forming because protonation prevents the formation of covalent bonds.\nCooked (set) custard is a weak gel, viscous, and thixotropic; while it does become easier to stir the more it is manipulated, it does not, unlike many other thixotropic liquids, recover its lost viscosity over time. On the other hand, a suspension of uncooked imitation custard powder (starch) in water, with the proper proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, allowing the demonstration of \"walking on custard\".",

        "doc": "Energy gels are edible carbohydrate gels that provide energy for exercise and promote recovery, commonly used in endurance events such as running, cycling, and triathlons.  Energy gels are also referred to as endurance gels, sports gels, nutritional gels, and carbohydrate gels. \nEnergy gels are packaged in small, single-serve plastic packets. Each packet has a strip with a small notch at the top that can be peeled off to reveal an opening through which the gel can be consumed. One-handed operation is often adopted by users to facilitate continuous exercise performance.\nThe size content of energy gels is commonly 1.2 oz (32g), with a range from 1 oz to 1.5 oz packets. The portable packaging is designed to facilitate uninterrupted training or performance conditions. Common ingredients include water, maltodextrin, fructose, and various micronutrients, preservatives, and flavor compounds or caffeine.Sports energy gels emerged in the United Kingdom in 1986 as a \"convenient, prewrapped, portable\" way to deliver carbohydrates during endurance events. Gels have a gooey texture and are sometimes referred to as \"goo\" generically. The gel Leppin Squeezy was distributed at the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon in 1988. Once considered a \"cult product in clear packaging\", energy gel products are now marketed in fancy packaging and come in a variety of flavors. The energy gel market grew during the 1990s, as professional athletes began endorsing products. Manufacturers generally encourage the consumption of multiple packets, with water, when participating in endurance events.Energy gels are promoted to individuals seeking a boost from caffeine and carbohydrates during exercise performance. The recommended use of an energy gel is 15 minutes before starting and 30:45 minutes after starting the endurance exercise.Energy gels have varied taste by addition of flavor ingredients added during manufacturing, such as menthol and chai latte.",

        "title": "Drinking",
        "doc": "Drinking is the act of ingesting water or other liquids into the body through the mouth, proboscis, or elsewhere. Humans drink by swallowing, completed by peristalsis in the esophagus. The physiological processes of drinking vary widely among other animals.\nMost animals drink water to maintain bodily hydration, although many can survive on the water gained from their food. Water is required for many physiological processes. Both inadequate and (less commonly) excessive water intake are associated with health problems.\nWhen a liquid enters a human mouth, the swallowing process is completed by peristalsis which delivers the liquid through the esophagus to the stomach; much of the activity is abetted by gravity. The liquid may be poured from the hands or drinkware may be used as vessels. Drinking can also be performed by acts of inhalation, typically when imbibing hot liquids or drinking from a spoon. Infants employ a method of suction wherein the lips are pressed tight around a source, as in breastfeeding: a combination of breath and tongue movement creates a vacuum which draws in liquid.By necessity, terrestrial animals in captivity become accustomed to drinking water, but most free-roaming animals stay hydrated through the fluids and moisture in fresh food, and learn to actively seek foods with high fluid content. When conditions impel them to drink from bodies of water, the methods and motions differ greatly among species.Cats, canines, and ruminants all lower the neck and lap in water with their powerful tongues. Cats and canines lap up water with the tongue in a spoon-like shape. Canines lap water by scooping it into their mouth with a tongue which has taken the shape of a ladle. However, with cats, only the tip of their tongue (which is smooth) touches the water, and then the cat quickly pulls its tongue back into its mouth which soon closes; this results in a column of liquid being pulled into the cat's mouth, which is then secured by its mouth closing. Ruminants and most other herbivores partially submerge the tip of the mouth in order to draw in water by means of a plunging action with the tongue held straight. Cats drink at a significantly slower pace than ruminants, who face greater natural predation hazards.\nMany desert animals do not drink even if water becomes available, but rely on eating succulent plants. In cold and frozen environments, some animals like hares, tree squirrels, and bighorn sheep resort to consuming snow and icicles. In savannas, the drinking method of giraffes has been a source of speculation for its apparent defiance of gravity; the most recent theory contemplates the animal's long neck functions like a plunger pump. Uniquely, elephants draw water into their trunks and squirt it into their mouths.\nMost birds scoop or draw water into the buccal areas of their bills, raising and tilting their heads back to drink. An exception is the common pigeon, which can suck in water directly by inhalation.Most insects obtain adequate water from their food: When dehydrated from a lack of moist food, however, many species will drink from standing water. Additionally, all terrestrial insects constantly absorb a certain amount of the air's humidity through their cuticles. Some desert insects, such as Onymacris unguicularis, have evolved to drink substantially from nighttime fog.Amphibians and aquatic animals which live in freshwater do not need to drink: they absorb water steadily through the skin by osmosis. Saltwater fish, however, drink through the mouth as they swim, and purge the excess salt through the gills.  Saltwater fishes do drink plenty of water and excrete a small volume of concentrated urine.Like nearly all other life forms, humans require water for tissue hydration. Lack of hydration causes thirst, a desire to drink which is regulated by the hypothalamus in response to subtle changes in the body's electrolyte levels and blood volume. A decline in total body water is called dehydration and will eventually lead to death by hypernatremia. Methods used in the management of dehydration include assisted drinking or oral rehydration therapy.An overconsumption of water can lead to water intoxication, which can dangerously dilute the concentration of salts in the body. Overhydration sometimes occurs among athletes and outdoor laborers, but it can also be a sign of disease or damage to the hypothalamus. A persistent desire to drink inordinate quantities of water is a psychological condition termed polydipsia. It is often accompanied by polyuria and may itself be a symptom of diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus.\nA daily intake of water is required for the normal physiological functioning of the human body. The USDA recommends a daily intake of total water: not necessarily by drinking but by consumption of water contained in other beverages and foods. The recommended intake is 3.7 liters (appx. 1 gallon) per day for an adult male, and 2.7 liters (appx. 0.75 gallon) for an adult female.Other sources, however, claim that a high intake of fresh drinking water, separate and distinct from other sources of moisture, is necessary for good health : eight servings per day of eight fluid ounces (1.8 liters, or 0.5 gallon) is the amount recommended by many nutritionists, although there is no scientific evidence supporting this recommendation.\nEvidence-based hydration experts say that the amount of drinking water needed depends on ambient temperature, activity level, body size, and sweat rate. Research shows drinking when thirsty will maintain hydration to within about 2% of the needed level. Drinking beyond thirst might be beneficial for people who need to perform tasks that require intense concentration, and those with kidney disease, kidney stones, urinary tract infections, and people with a weak sense of thirst (which may include more older people).\nThe term \"drinking\" is often used metonymically for the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Most cultures throughout history have incorporated some number of the wide variety of \"strong drinks\" into their meals, celebrations, ceremonies, toasts and other occasions. Evidence of fermented drinks in human culture goes back as early as the Neolithic Period, and the first pictorial evidence can be found in Egypt around 4,000 BC.Alcohol consumption has developed into a variety of well-established drinking cultures around the world. Despite its popularity, alcohol consumption poses significant health risks. Alcohol abuse and the addiction of alcoholism are common maladies in developed countries worldwide. A high rate of consumption can also lead to cirrhosis, gastritis, gout, pancreatitis, hypertension, various forms of cancer, and numerous other illnesses.\n",

        "doc": "Food engineering is a scientific, academic, and professional field that interprets and applies principles of engineering, science, and mathematics to food manufacturing and operations, including the processing, production, handling, storage, conservation, control, packaging and distribution of food products. Given its reliance on food science and broader engineering disciplines such as electrical, mechanical, civil, chemical, industrial and agricultural engineering, food engineering is considered a multidisciplinary and narrow field. \nDue to the complex nature of food materials, food engineering also combines the study of more specific chemical and physical concepts such as biochemistry, microbiology, food chemistry, thermodynamics, transport phenomena, rheology, and heat transfer. Food engineers apply this knowledge to the cost-effective design, production, and commercialization of sustainable, safe, nutritious, healthy, appealing, affordable and high-quality ingredients and foods, as well as to the development of food systems, machinery, and instrumentation.\nAlthough food engineering is a relatively recent and evolving field of study, it is based on long-established concepts and activities. The traditional focus of food engineering was preservation, which involved stabilizing and sterilizing foods, preventing spoilage, and preserving nutrients in food for prolonged periods of time. More specific traditional activities include food dehydration and concentration, protective packaging, canning and freeze-drying . The development of food technologies were greatly influenced and urged by wars and long voyages, including space missions, where long-lasting and nutritious foods were essential for survival. Other ancient activities include milling, storage, and fermentation processes. Although several traditional activities remain of concern and form the basis of today’s technologies and innovations, the focus of food engineering has recently shifted to food quality, safety, taste, health and sustainability.The following are some of the applications and practices used in food engineering to produce safe, healthy, tasty, and sustainable food:The main objective of food refrigeration and/or freezing is to preserve the quality and safety of food materials. Refrigeration and freezing contribute to the preservation of perishable foods, and to the conservation some food quality factors such as visual appearance, texture, taste, flavor and nutritional content. Freezing food slows the growth of bacteria that could potentially harm consumers.Evaporation is used to pre-concentrate, increase the solid content, change the color, and reduce the water content of food and liquid products. This process is mostly seen when processing milk, starch derivatives, coffee, fruit juices, vegetable pastes and concentrates, seasonings, sauces, sugar, and edible oil. Evaporation is also used in food dehydration processes. The purpose of dehydration is to prevent the growth of molds in food, which only build when moisture is present. This process can be applied to vegetables, fruits, meats, and fish, for example.Food packaging technologies are used to extend the shelf-life of products, to stabilize food (preserve taste, appearance, and quality), and to maintain the food clean, protected, and appealing to the consumer. This can be achieved, for example, by packaging food in cans and jars. Because food production creates large amounts of waste, many companies are transitioning to eco-friendly packaging to preserve the environment and attract the attention of environmentally conscious consumers. Some types of environmentally friendly packaging include plastics made from corn or potato, bio-compostable plastic and paper products which disintegrate, and recycled content. Even though transitioning to eco-friendly packaging has positive effects on the environment, many companies are finding other benefits such as reducing excess packaging material, helping to attract and retain customers, and showing that companies care about the environment.To increase sustainability of food processing there is a need for energy efficiency and waste heat recovery. The replacement of conventional energy-intensive food processes with new technologies like thermodynamic cycles and non-thermal heating processes provide another potential to reduce energy consumption, reduce production costs, and improve the sustainability in food production.Heat transfer is important in the processing of almost every commercialized food product and is important to preserve the hygienic, nutritional and sensory qualities of food. Heat transfer methods include induction, convection, and radiation. These methods are used to create variations in the physical properties of food when freezing, baking, or deep frying products, and also when applying ohmic heating or infrared radiation to food. These tools allow food engineers to innovate in the creation and transformation of food products.A Food Safety Management System (FSMS) is \"a systematic approach to controlling food safety hazards within a business in order to ensure that the food product is safe to consume.\" In some countries FSMS is a legal requirement, which obliges all food production businesses to use and maintain a FSMS based on the principles of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP). HACCP is a management system that addresses food safety through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards in all stages of the food supply chain. The ISO 22000 standard specifies the requirements for FSMS.The following technologies, which continue to evolve, have contributed to the innovation and advancement of food engineering practices:Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the process of using digital files to create three dimensional objects. In the food industry, 3D printing of food is used for the processing of food layers using computer equipment. The process of 3D printing is slow, but is improving over time with the goal of reducing costs and processing times. Some of the successful food items that have been printed through 3D technology are: chocolate, cheese, cake frosting, turkey, pizza, celery, among others. This technology is continuously improving, and has the potential of providing cost-effective, energy efficient food that meets nutritional stability, safety and variety.Biosensors can be used for quality control in laboratories and in different stages of food processing. Biosensor technology is one way in which farmers and food processors have adapted to the worldwide increase in demand for food, while maintaining their food production and quality high. Furthermore, since millions of people are affected by food-borne diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, biosensors are becoming an important tool to ensure the safety of food. They help track and analyze food quality during several parts of the supply chain: in food processing, shipping and commercialization. Biosensors can also help with the detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), to help regulate GMO products. With the advancement of technologies, like nanotechnology, the quality and uses of biosensors are constantly being improved.When storage conditions of milk are controlled, milk tends to have a very good flavor. However, oxidized flavor is a problem that affects the taste and safety of milk in a negative way. To prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria and extend the shelf life of milk, pasteurization processes were developed. Microwaved milk has been studied and developed to prevent oxidation compared to traditional pasteurized milk methods, and it has been concluded that milk has a better quality when it has microwaved milk pasteurization.In the 1950s, food engineering emerged as an academic discipline, when several U.S. universities included food science and food technology in their curricula, and important works on food engineering appeared. Today, educational institutions throughout the world offer bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in food engineering. However, due to the unique character of food engineering, its training is more often offered as a branch of broader programs on food science, food technology, biotechnology, or agricultural and chemical engineering. In other cases, institutions offer food engineering education through concentrations, specializations, or minors. Food engineering candidates receive multidisciplinary training in areas like mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, microbiology, nutrition, and law.Food engineering is still growing and developing as a field of study, and academic curricula continue to evolve. Future food engineering programs are subject to change due to the current challenges in the food industry, including bio-economics, food security, population growth, food safety, changing eating behavior, globalization, climate change, energy cost and change in value chain, fossil fuel prices, and sustainability. To address these challenges, which require the development of new products, services, and processes, academic programs are incorporating innovative and practical forms of training. For example, innovation laboratories, research programs, and projects with food companies and equipment manufacturers are being adopted by some universities. In addition, food engineering competitions and competitions from other scientific disciplines are appearing.\nWith the growing demand for safe, sustainable, and healthy food, and for environmentally friendly processes and packaging, there is a large job market for food engineering prospective employees. Food engineers are typically employed by the food industry, academia, government agencies, research centers, consulting firms, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare firms, and entrepreneurial projects. Job descriptions include but are not limited to food engineer, food microbiologist, bioengineering/biotechnology, nutrition, traceability, food safety and quality management.\nFood engineering has negative impacts on the environment such as the emission of large quantities of waste and the pollution of water and air, which must be addressed by food engineers in the future development of food production and processing operations. Scientists and engineers are experimenting in different ways to create improved processes that reduce pollution, but these must continue to be improved in order to achieve a sustainable food supply chain. Food engineers must reevaluate current practices and technologies to focus on increasing productivity and efficiency while reducing the consumption of water and energy, and decreasing the amount of waste produced.Even though food supply expands yearly, there has also been an increase in the number of hungry people. The world population is expected to reach 9-10 billion people by 2050 and the problem of malnutrition remains a priority. To achieve food security, food engineers are required to address land and water scarcity to provide enough growth and food for undernourished people. In addition, food production depends on land and water supply, which are under stress as the population size increases. There is a growing pressure on land resources driven by expanding populations, leading to expansions of croplands; this usually involves the destruction of forests and exploitation of arable land. Food engineers face the challenge of finding sustainable ways to produce to adapt to the growing population.Food engineers must adapt food technologies and operations to the recent consumer trend toward the consumption of healthy and nutritious food. To supply foods with these qualities, and for the benefit of human health, food engineers must work collaboratively with professionals in other domains such as medicine, biochemistry, chemistry, and consumerism. New technologies and practices must be developed to increase the production of foods that have a positive impact on human health.",

        "title": "Developer_relations",
        "doc": "Developer relations, abbreviated as DevRel, is an umbrella term for practices employed by an organization that builds developer-facing software to connect with the developers that use that software. Developer relations is a form of platform evangelism and the activities involved are sometimes referred to as a developer program or a DevRel program. DevRel programs often include the following:\nDeveloper marketing: Outreach and engagement activities to create awareness and encourage developers to use a product.\nDeveloper education: Product documentation and resources such as videos to aid learning a product.\nDeveloper experience: Often referred to as \"zeroth customer\" and \"friction logging\", devrel programs include using the product directly, finding problems, and improving the developer experience.\nDeveloper success: Activities to nurture and retain developers as they build and scale with a product.\nCommunity: Events, forums, and social groups around the product.\nApple is considered to have created the first DevRel program in the 1980s, starting with Mike Murray, who coined the term software evangelist to persuade third-party developers to develop software and applications for the Macintosh platform. Mike Boich was Apple's first Software Evangelist for the Macintosh project  and hired Guy Kawasaki who would become Apple's Chief Evangelist and popularize their DevRel program.In 1997, the Microsoft Developer Relations Group created and distributed resources aimed at advancing Microsoft’s success through the support of independent software vendors (ISVs). This strategy, detailed in presentations and emails, focused on facilitating the development and distribution of applications based on the Windows platform. The success of evangelists was measured by the amount of Windows applications their ISVs built and marketed. \nIn the following decades many companies formed DevRel programs. In the 2010s companies like New Relic, Twilio, EngineYard, and SendGrid branded DevRel programs as a \"Developer-First approach\".\nDevRel theoretically intersects engineering, marketing, product management, and community management.There are several different types of roles/job titles in DevRel including:\nDeveloper Advocates (aka Developer Evangelists): Focus on getting the word out (i.e., evangelizing) through various means such as speaking at conferences, attending meetups, hosting hackathons, creating code samples, building webinars, hosting virtual office hours and/or advocating by acting as a liaison between the community and internal product teams. They likely have coding experience and may collect feedback, create demos/code samples, or find solutions to issues with the product.\nDeveloper Experience (DX) Practitioners: Own user experience initiatives for products developers use. DX encompasses both products and documentation, and DX practitioners may deal with SDK or API design, onboarding flows, and documentation.\nTechnical Community Managers: Community managers who focus on conversations of a technical nature, about technical aspects of a product. They may identify and track opportunities for Developer Advocacy teams to educate and inspire their peer developers.\nDeveloper Marketers: Target and capture software developers' attention to grow awareness, adoption and advocacy of tools, solutions, and platforms. They focus on solving real-world problems by providing solutions to help developers improve their workflows and increase development efficiency. They also facilitate developer advocacy by empowering and evangelizing developers to champion a target product.\nTechnical Writers: Technical writers produce content such as online help, manuals, white papers, etc. A technical writer is often considered a DevRel role.\nDevRel practitioners may report to different groups within an organization : both technical and non-technical. In a 2021 survey, DevRel practitioners when asked \"Which department does your DevRel team report to?\" answered the following:Annual salaries for DevRel practitioners vary from less than US$50,000 to over $250,000 in some cases. A survey from 2021 indicates that the largest segment of annual salaries was between $100,000 and $150,000.Organizations which practice DevRel may be Developer-first or Developer-plus (aka Dev +) depending on their primary business model. Developer-First companies (e.g., Stripe, Camunda, PerceptiLabs, Unity, and Twilio) have a business-to-developer model (B2D) focused on selling products specifically designed to be used by developers. Developer-Plus companies (e.g., Slack, Spotify, Apple, Qualcomm, and Santander) tend to be business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C). While the primary focus of Developer-Plus companies is to create and sell products for businesses or consumers, they also make products or services available to developers which benefit or enhance their strategy including: opening new market channels, creating new use cases, contributing to innovation strategies, or optimizing/enhancing existing products.In 2021, a survey showed that 63.6% of organizations with DevRel programs were Developer-Plus, and 36.4% were Developer-First.\nRegardless of Developer-Plus or Developer-First, companies are recognizing the growing power developers have in influencing purchasing decisions. This includes new companies focused on making tools for developers, and existing companies whose primary focus was elsewhere, which are now recognizing the developer opportunity. Thus, business leaders are now involved in starting new DevRel programs at their companies or increasing the impact of their existing programs.Products or services targeted at developers comprise an estimated $49 billion (in 2021) Developer-Led landscape that spans many categories including:\nSoftware Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC): SDLC solutions for processes such as designing, developing, and testing software.\nDev Tools: Tools for building software.\nDev Infrastructure: Hardware and software that support the distributed, repeatable construction of software.\nDev Platforms: Developer-interfacing, code-first, and API-only runtimes.\nTwilio, is an example of a Developer-First company, and more specifically an API-first company, that helped to shape the API economy (business models and practices designed around APIs), popularize DevRel programs, and became known for platform evangelism. Notably, their three-word billboard in Silicon Valley that simply said: \"Ask Your Developer\", followed by the Twilio logo, is credited with having started conversations between executives and developers in strategic decision making.\n",

        "doc": "The ancient Egyptians were one of the first cultures to widely divide days into generally agreed-upon equal parts, using early timekeeping devices such as sundials, shadow clocks, and merkhets (plumb-lines used by early astronomers).\nObelisks were also used by reading the shadow that they make. The clock was split into daytime and nighttime, and then into smaller hours.\nDespite Herodotus's attribution of the invention of the sundial to the Babylonians in 430 BCE, the earliest known sundials were simple gnomons of Egyptian origin invented around 3500 BCE . More complex devices were developed over time, the earliest surviving one is a limestone sundial that dates back to 1500 BCE, discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 2013. It was found in a housing area of construction workers and its division of daytime into 12 parts was possibly used to measure work hours.Shadow clocks were modified sundials that allowed for greater precision in determining the time of day, and were first used around 1500 BCE. Their major innovation was a modified, more precise gnomon that allowed for the division of night time into 50 parts, with an additional two \"twilight hours\" in the morning and evening. The shadow clock gnomon was made up of a long stem divided into six parts, as well as an elevated crossbar that cast a shadow over the marks. This early clock was positioned eastward in the morning, while at noon it was rotated to face west to measure shadows cast by the setting sun. The concept of measured shadows were adapted into larger, more public designs in the form of obelisks. Markers around the obelisk would indicate units of time, including morning and afternoon as well as the summer and winter solstices for ceremonial purposes.\nUsing plumb-lines called merkhets, the Egyptians could calculate time at night, provided the stars were visible. Used since at least 600 BCE, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the North pole star, creating a north:south meridian. By observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets, they could accurately gauge time.",

        "doc": "Food models, also known as fake foods, food figurines or \"food samples\" , are scale models or replicas of a food item or dish made from plastic, wax, resin, or a similar inedible material. They are commonly used as mockups in restaurant display windows and shelves in Japan, although other countries like South Korea and China also use such models for similar purposes in restaurants, food booths, and food carts.\nUsing food models allow food vendors to advertise to consumers a three-dimensional image of their products, while avoiding the need to put real food on display unattended for prolonged periods of time, which can get contaminated, spoiled, or attract unpleasant pests like flies, cockroaches and ants.\nIn Japan, shokuhin sampuru, taken from the English \"sample\", are widespread. In the late Edo period, in the 1800s, food sellers displayed a plate of real food each day in lieu of a written menu. During the early Shōwa period, in the late 1920s, Japanese artisans and candle makers developed food models that made it easy for patrons to order without the use of menus, which were not common in Japan at that time. Paraffin was used to create these until the mid-1980s, but because its colors faded when exposed to heat or sunlight, manufacturers later switched to polyvinyl chloride, which is \"nearly eternal\".The plastic models are mostly handmade from polyvinyl chloride and sculpted to look like the actual dishes. The models can be custom-tailored to individual restaurants and even common items such as ramen can be modified to match each establishment's food or regional differences. During the molding process, the imitation ingredients are often chopped up and combined in a manner similar to actual cooking.\nMany restaurants in Japan use replicas to display their popular dishes in their windows and attract customers. The plastic food manufacturers fiercely guard their trade secrets as business is lucrative; the plastic food industry in Japan, by conservative estimates, has revenues of billions of yen per year. A single restaurant may order a complete menu of plastic items costing over a million yen (equivalent to about 7,900 Euros or US$ 9,600). The plastic replicas are much more expensive than the food they imitate, but can last indefinitely. For this reason, many companies that manufacture fake food have stagnant or declining profits. Because some individual pieces can be very expensive, sometimes restaurants rent the pieces instead of buying them outright.  They are also sold to the general public in some retail stores in Tokyo's \"Kitchen Town\" restaurant supply district. \nThe craftsmanship has been raised to an art form. Japanese plastic food models by the Maizuru Company were exhibited at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 1980. Regular competitions are held in making fake food dishes out of plastic and other materials.\nFake and replica foods are used in many ways, such as props for backgrounds in movies, television shows, theatrical plays, television commercials, print ads, and trade shows. Food models are also used to display lifelike replicas of real foods for restaurants, grocery chains, museums, banquet halls, casino buffets, cruise ships, and in many other instances in which real foods cannot be displayed. For instance, the American company Fake Foods began when fast food restaurants Wendy's needed artificial kale for their salad bar display.In the 2010s, models of foods and dishes were also used for nutrition education and consumer research.\nIn North America, fake food is often used for retail displays. Furniture retailers use it in showrooms (such as a bowl of fake apples) to give their furniture settings a lived-in look.\nSometimes at weddings, the bride and groom opt to have an elaborately decorated dummy wedding cake for show while everyone is served slices of sheet cake.\nModern manufacturing technologies and high quality plastic materials provide realistic-looking fake food replicas, but approximately 95% of all fake food is still handcrafted. Artisans and highly trained craftsmen make realistic fake food, often painting them by hand to create a realistic look and feel.\nWhen fake food is made using a mold, the mold is created by dipping real food into silicone. A liquid plastic, typically polyvinyl chloride, is chosen in a color that matches the food, before being poured into the mold and heated in an oven until it solidifies. (When a food sample is not available or would disintegrate or melt in the mold during casting, a clay model of the food must instead be sculpted.) After setting for ten to thirty minutes, any excess vinyl buildup is trimmed off, and the replica is painted either by hand or airbrush. If the food comprises several parts, such as a hamburger or sushi roll, the item is assembled from separate vinyl pieces.\nWhile some large-scale fake food manufacturing companies exist, others are small shops with a single proprietor. Fake food items can be found and purchased in Kappabashi-dori, the food supply street in Tokyo and also at Doguyasuji located in Namba, Osaka. Factories can be found in Gujō, Gifu. Iwasaki Be-I is the biggest plastic food manufacturer in Japan, founded by Takizo Iwasaki in 1932. Maiduru is another old and large manufacturer.\n",

        "doc": "Wei-Ying Ma is known for his contributions to the field of computer science, including his academic achievements and leadership in technological innovation. He has authored over 300 papers and obtained 169 patents as of January 2024. He has served on the editorial boards of the ACM Transactions on Information System (TOIS) and the ACM/Springer Multimedia Systems Journal. He also served as a program co-chair of the International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW) 2008, a program co-chair of the Pacific Rim Conference on Multimedia (PCM) '07, and the general co-chair of the Asia Information Retrieval Symposium (AIRS) '08. He was the general co-chair of ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR) 2011 and also a member of the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee from 2010 through 2016. As Vice President and head of the AI lab at ByteDance, he led the development of AI-powered technologies integrated into platforms like Douyin, TikTok, and Jinri Toutiao, which impacted digital content creation and distribution. Wei-Ying Ma currently holds the position of Huiyan Chair Professor at Tsinghua University and serves as the Chief Scientist at the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), a program he established alongside Dr. Ya-Qin Zhang in 2020.\nWei-Ying Ma obtained a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan in 1990. He furthered his studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, earning a Master of Science in 1994, and a Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 1997. During his doctoral studies, Ma was involved in the Alexandria Digital Library project, focusing on the development of innovative image retrieval systems and segmentation solutions.He began his professional career at Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto, California, where he focused on multimedia content analysis and adaptation. Ma joined Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) in 2001 and took the position of Assistant Managing Director. In this role, he supervised research groups that were instrumental in the development of technologies for Microsoft's Bing Search Engine and Microsoft Advertising. He developed techniques for web page analysis by utilizing visual cues to extract structured data. This work led to the creation of Microsoft Academic Search, a search engine that offers automatic entity summaries and improved user navigation. Additionally, he led projects such as the Microsoft Graph Engine, facilitating knowledge graph processing for web search and natural language understanding, and the creation of the Microsoft Concept Graph, a comprehensive repository of concepts and facts derived from extensive web and search data. Furthermore, he led developing the Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit, which aimed to improve the efficiency and scalability of machine learning tasks involving large datasets.Wei-Ying Ma joined ByteDance in 2016, assuming the position of Vice President and Head of the AI Lab in 2017. During his time at ByteDance, Ma established the ByteDance AI Lab to focus on research and technology development in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Ma contributed to the development of AI-powered content creation and dissemination technologies integrated into ByteDance's products, including Douyin, TikTok, Jinri Toutiao, CapCut, and Lark. The number of AI researchers increased from five in 2016, to 150 by the end of 2018. He and his team worked on the development of machine learning models for content analysis, video analysis systems, and innovative techniques for music generation, recommendation, speech recognition, and content creation.\nMa left ByteDance in 2020. His departure coincided with regulatory challenges faced by TikTok worldwide. The app was banned in India in June of that year.  There was also a possible ban by the US Government due to security concerns and suspicions that Beijing could force the owner, who is of Chinese descent, to turn over user data.\nUpon Leaving Bytedance, Ma transitioned to AI Industry Research (AIR), a research institute under Tsinghua University in Beijing. This initiative, led by scientist and entrepreneur Dr. Ya-Qin Zhang, established a center dedicated to scientific research and technological innovation focusing on areas such as autonomous driving, AI+IoT, and neuromorphic computing.\nAdditionally, Ma co-founded Helixon, a startup aimed at advancing next-generation AI for antibody design and protein therapeutics discovery. He also served as Director of the Health Computing Research Center at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) from 2021 to 2023 advancing AI applications in healthcare.\nAs of 2024, Ma is leading AI initiatives for scientific applications, with a specific emphasis on AI-driven drug discovery and generative AI for biology and chemistry.\nWei-Ying Ma has been recognized with several awards throughout his career. In 2009, he received the Management Excellence Trailblazer Award at Microsoft for his contributions within the organization. In 2010, he was honored as a Distinguished Alumni of the school of EECS at Tsinghua University. His contributions to the field were further acknowledged when he received the ACM Distinguished Member award in the US in 2010. In 2023, Wei-Ying Ma was recognized as an ACM Fellow in the US for his leadership and significant contributions to web search and data mining. Additionally, for his work at ByteDance, Ma received the Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Award.",

        "title": "Geomatics",
        "doc": "Geomatics is defined in the ISO/TC 211 series of standards as the \"discipline concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of geographic data or geographic information\". Under another definition, it consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic (geospatial) data. Surveying engineering was the widely used name for geomatic(s) engineering in the past. Geomatics was placed by the UNESCO Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems under the branch of technical geography.\nThe term was proposed in French (\"géomatique\") at the end of the 1960s by scientist Bernard Dubuisson to reflect at the time recent changes in the jobs of surveyor and photogrammetrist. The term was first employed in a French Ministry of Public Works memorandum dated 1 June 1971 instituting a \"standing committee of geomatics\" in the government.The term was popularised in English by French-Canadian surveyor Michel Paradis in his The little Geodesist that could article, in 1981 and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the Canadian Institute of Surveying (now known as the Canadian Institute of Geomatics) in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and that, in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.\nGeomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), global navigation satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou), photogrammetry, geophysics, geography, and related forms of earth mapping. The term was originally used in Canada but has since been adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the United States) have shown a preference for the term geospatial technology, which may be defined as synonym of \"geospatial information and communications technology\".\nAlthough many definitions of geomatics, such as the above, appear to encompass the entire discipline relating to geographic information : including geodesy, geographic information systems, remote sensing, satellite navigation, and cartography :, the term is almost exclusively restricted to the perspective of surveying and engineering toward geographic information. Geoinformatics and Geographic information science has been proposed as alternative comprehensive term; however, their popularity is, like geomatics, largely dependent on country.\nThe related field of hydrogeomatics covers the area associated with surveying work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of water. The older term of hydrographics was considered too specific to the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of positioning or measurements in all marine environments. The use of different data processing technologies in hydrography does not change the purpose of its research.\nHealth geomatics can improve our understanding of the important relationship between location and health, and thus assist us in Public Health tasks like disease prevention, and also in better healthcare service planning. An important area of research is the use of open data in planning lifesaving activities. \nMining geomatics is the use of information systems to integrate and process spatial data for monitoring, modelling, visualisation and design of mining operations. \nA growing number of university departments which were once titled \"surveying\", \"survey engineering\" or \"topographic science\" have re-titled themselves using the terms \"geomatics\" or \"geomatics engineering\", while others have switched to program titles such as \"spatial information technology\", and similar names.\nThe rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has been made possible by advances in computer hardware, computer science, and software engineering, as well as by airborne and space observation remote-sensing technologies.\nGeomatics engineering is a rapidly developing engineering discipline which focuses on spatial information (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade features.Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.\n",

        "doc": "Creative technology is a broadly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field combining computing, design, art and the humanities. The field of creative technology encompasses art, digital product design, digital media or an advertising and media made with a software-based, electronic and/or data-driven engine. Examples include multi-sensory experiences made using computer graphics, video production, digital music, digital cinematography, virtual reality, augmented reality, video editing, software engineering, 3D printing, the Internet of Things, CAD/CAM and wearable technology.\nIn the artistic field, new media art and internet art are examples of work being done using creative technology. Performances, interactive installations and other immersive experiences take museum-going to the next level and may serve as research processes for humans' artistic and emotional integration with machines. Some believe that \"creativity has the potential to be revolutionised with technology\", or view the field of creative technology as helping to \"disrupt\" the way people today interact with computers, and usher in a more integrated, immersive experience.\nCreative technology has been defined as \"the blending of knowledge across multiple disciplines to create new experiences or products\" that meet end user and organizational needs. A more specific conceptualization describes it as the combination of information, holographic systems, sensors, audio technologies, image, and video technologies, among others with artistic practices and methods. The central characteristic is identified as an ability to do things better.Creative technology is also seen as the intersection of new technology with creative initiatives such as fashion, art, advertising, media and entertainment. As such, it is a way to make connections between countries seeking to update their culture; a winter 2015 Forbes article tells of 30 creative technology startups from the UK making the rounds in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and New York City in an effort to raise funds and make connections.\nCreative technology facilities may be organized as arts, research or job development entities, such as the UK's Foundation for Art and Creative Technology which has presented hundreds of new media and digital artworks from around the world, or a recently established $20.5 million project in Hawaii specializing in film industry job training and workforce development programs which plans to offer robotics, computer labs, recording studios and editing bays, pitched as a \"game-changing\" opportunity to bring new skills and jobs to Kauai. Degrees in this field were designed to address needs for cross-disciplinary interaction and aim to develop lateral thinking skills across more rigidly defined academic areas. Some educators have complained that creative technology tools, though \"widely available\", are difficult to use for young populations.The first major corporation to have a corporate officer bearing the title creative technology was The Walt Disney Company, which gave it first to the imagineer, Bran Ferren in 1993, who eventually became Disney's president of creative technology in 1998. At about the same time, the first educational research center in the United States was created to bridge these disciplines across industry, academia and the defense communities, designated the University of Southern California's, Institute for Creative Technologies. The ICT was established with funding by the US Army.\nMarketers and advertisers are also looking toward the power of creative technology to re-engage customers. The UK's Marketing Agencies Association is promoting creative technology as a way to build a more connected and personalized engagement with prospective customers, which launched a Creative Technology Initiative in early 2015. Industry associations and developers, arts organizations and agency creatives alike call for more investment in technology, which has lagged behind the sea change in the industry that is introducing more technology into creative fields such as Google. Many advertising agencies and other businesses have begun to create internal labs for research in creative technology. For example, Unilever created its Foundry Project as a way for the company to \"embrace the mentality of hacking, deploying and scaling\"; they share their discoveries and view the lab as a way to incorporate technology into the company, drive experimentation and engage with strategic partners.  The Adobe Creative Technologies lab collaborated with the MIT Media Lab, one of the most notable endeavors in the creative technology field, to give artists the ability to draw geometric designs with a computer without having to master text-based programming or math.\n\"Creativeapplications.Net (CAN) is a community of creative practitioners working at the intersection of art, media and technology.\"A pepper grinder that disabled wifi in the household when twisted was introduced by the head of creative technology at agency Clemenger BBDO.\nZKM has an annual prize for creative apps, the App Art Awards\nITP (the Interactive Telecommunications Program) has a class in \"Creative Computing\"\n\"The Eyeo Festival brings together a rich intersection of people doing fascinating things with technology. Artists, data designers, creative coders, AI & XR explorers, storytellers, researchers, technology & platform developers all cross paths and share inspiration at Eyeo\"\nArtist Jake Lee-High created an interactive street experience for the premiere of Showtime (TV network) Penny Dreadful\n\"Fake Love promotes major brands with immersive, wildly imaginative multimedia spectacles, from light-projected racetracks for Lexus to virtual reality (VR) videos for the New York Times Company\"\nThe works of Becky Stern, an electronics and fashion artist based in New York City.\n\"You’re waving your hands in-front of a big screen and the designs and patterns mimic your movements; You walk into a company’s lobby and a digital wall displays a beautiful, abstract visualization based on the company's sales data\"\nFIT has an annual Creative Technology Exhibition\nProfessionals who work in the field of creative technology tend to have a background as developers and may work in digital or entertainment media, with an advertising agency or in a new electronic product development role. In an advertising agency setting, a professional with a job description including creative technology may be a designer who became interested in technology, or a developer who focuses on the bigger picture of experience design. Department heads in creative technology may be charged with integrating new technologies into the agency's departments, leveraging partnerships with cutting edge providers and platforms. For example, the head of creative technology at Grey Global Group in New York \"created an in-house lab... which highlights new tech each month with exhibits, events and workshops.\" Members of the team may have the ability to both write computer code and build electronics for prototypes.The creative technologist job title is likely to refer to a developer who understands the creative process and (often) the world of advertising. The person is actually making and coding and may be building web projects, mobile apps and other digital experiences. They are trying out new concepts and ideas, and modifying; this is recognized as similar to the artistic process but applied to media, advertising and other creative industries. Creative technologists have been referred to as technology-focussed individuals who either sit within or work closely with the creative team, recognizing that siloed departments of technology and design have historically led to bad agency work.  Responsibilities described in a 2014 job posting for \"Creative Technologist\" at Google included \"collaborating on the ideation and development of 'never been done before' digital experiences in partnership with top brands and agencies\", and \"contributing to the development of cutting edge prototypes in the field of creative technology\". There are several resources that list companies that work in the field of creative technology.\nA Master or Bachelor degree in creative technologies or creative technology is a broadly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary course of study combining fields of computer technology, design, art and the humanities. Established as a modern degree addressing needs for cross-disciplinary interaction, one of its fundamental objectives is to develop lateral thinking skills across more rigidly defined academic areas recognized as a valuable component in expanding technological horizons. The Creative Technology & Design (CT&D) subject area at Fashion Institute of Technology offers specialized courses and both credit and non-credit programs. According to FIT's web site, the mission of this transdisciplinary subject area is to elevate students’ understanding of advanced design concepts, as well as their command of cutting-edge technologies. The Creative Technology 2-year portfolio program at Miami Ad School description reads, \"You are a techie with creative passion and talent : or : a creative with a knack for tech...It's about how we integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence into a creative environment\".  Creative Technology is also seen as an industry and skill set for the emerging economy, as in this quote by a University of Texas at Austin dean at the opening of a new school at the University presumed to become the largest academic unit in the college: \"The School of Design and Creative Technologies moves UT Austin more assertively into emerging creative, commercial disciplines that are driving culture and economies in the 21st century\".",

        "doc": "The Geography Cup is an online, international competition between the United States and the United Kingdom, with the aim of determining which nation collectively knows more about geography. It was also intended to raise awareness of the importance of world geography in the modern world. Any resident of the US or UK could participate to test their own geographic knowledge and to support their nation. The first (and so far only) competition took place between 12 November and 31 December 2006 to coincide with Geography Awareness Week, the third week in November.\nThe Geography Cup was created in late 2006 by two geography enthusiasts: Roger Andresen from Atlanta, Georgia, and Daniel Raven-Ellison, a geography teacher from Reading, Berkshire. Both became committed to expanding public awareness of the importance of geography after seeing the results of polls illustrating Americans' and Britons' startling lack of geographical knowledge. A poll of young Americans conducted in the United States  by National Geographic in 2006 found that only 37% of those polled could find Iraq on a map, and half could not even find the state of New York.Andresen and Raven-Ellison created the competition for two main reasons. One reason was to determine whether people who live in the United States or people who live in the United Kingdom knew more about world geography. However, the main reason was to encourage people to learn more about world geography and to understand the importance of geography. \nThe two creators plan to hold the competition yearly beginning in the third week in November to coincide with Geography Awareness Week, established in the United States by Ronald Reagan in 1987. In 2007, more than 18,000 people participated.\nAny citizen of the USA or the UK was eligible to participate in the contest. Upon signup, the website determined which country a user lived in based on their IP address and automatically put the user into the correct team. The quiz consisted of thirteen random, geography-related questions that had to be answered in a total of two minutes. The first ten questions consisted of placing randomly selected countries onto a blank political map. The final three questions consisted of geography-related trivia questions that were answered by selecting the correct country on the blank map. Each user could practice, affect their own score, and learn about geography by playing as many times as they wanted to, but only three plays per 24-hour period could affect their nation's score.The randomly selected countries could be any country (or territory) in the world. This included the large and well-known regions (Russia, Canada, United States, etc.) as well as smaller and more obscure nations (Palau, Djibouti, Togo, etc.). Most participants had little trouble recognizing the major European and Asian countries but many people on both teams had trouble locating small Pacific Islands and some African countries.\nThe trivia questions were sometimes related directly to geography, e. g., \"Made up of 33 atolls, which country straddles both the equator and the International Date Line?\" (Kiribati). However, some were about current events to test if participants knew where, geographically, news stories were taking place, e. g., \"Which Asian country recently made its first test of a nuclear weapon?\" (North Korea).\nDue to the large difference in population between the United States and the United Kingdom, the score of each team was determined by an average percentage based on the percentage scores of each individual player. After each game, a player could see how he or she affected their nation's score and their own personal percentage. Because there were 13 questions, each question was worth approximately 7.7%.The USA won with a final accuracy score of 62.368% after trailing for a few days, while the UK lagged behind slightly at the end with an accuracy of 57.947%. The USA had 41,885 participants while the UK team had 10,820, indicating about 30% greater per capita participation in the UK.Users in Britain using Internet Explorer reported some problems with the website. Also, some US and UK residents were rejected or put into the incorrect team because their internet service provider used overseas servers. Finally, after the surge of media attention following the Reuters and Christian Science Monitor articles, the number of users exceeded the capacity of the servers, causing a temporary suspension of the competition.The Geography Cup was sponsored by A Broader View, founded by Roger Andresen to decrease geographical ignorance with geography puzzles and games. It is also sponsored by Give Geography Its Place, founded by Daniel Raven-Ellison and David Rayner to raise awareness of the importance geography in UK media. The third sponsor is Nelson Thornes, a UK-based educational publisher owned by Wolters Kluwer.The Geographic Alliance in Nevada (GAIN), part of National Geographic EdNet, encouraged its members to participate in the competition in the belief that \"It is only fitting that these two countries compete in a geography competition, as they both share the same widely-publicized affliction.\" Polls in the United States, including the National Geographic-Roper poll, and similar polls in the UK, which include a magazine poll cited by the BBC, illustrate a glaring lack of geographic knowledge by young people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, a group of geography teachers and enthusiasts from the UK on a Staffordshire Learning Net geography forum supported the competition and encouraged students to try to improve their nation's score.",

        "title": "Rosgen_Stream_Classification",
        "doc": "The Rosgen Stream Classification is a system for natural rivers in which morphological arrangements of stream characteristics are organized into relatively homogeneous stream types. This is a widely used method for classifying streams and rivers based on common patterns of channel morphology. The specific objectives of this stream classification system are as follows) predict a rivers behavior from its appearance; 2) develop specific hydrologic and sediment relationships for a given stream type and its state; 3) provide mechanisms to extrapolate site-specific data to stream reaches having similar characteristics; and 4) provide a consistent frame of reference for communicating stream morphology and condition among a variety of disciplines and interested parties. These objectives are met through Rosgen's four hierarchical levels (I-IV) of river morphology.\nLevel I categorize stream types into letters A - G based on their geomorphic characteristics that result from the integration of basin relief, land form, and valley morphology. This is a general way in which the morphology of a stream can be described. Many of the Level I criteria can be determined through topographic and landform maps, aerial imagery, and geospatial data.Level II characterizes stream type by using numbers 1 - 6, in addition to letters A - G, to include the assessments of the channel cross-section, longitudinal profile, and plan-form pattern. Cross-section measurements include a streams entrenchment ratio, width/depth ratio, and dominant substrate. The longitudinal and plan-form measurements consist of slope, stream bed features, sinuosity, and meander width ratio. Level II is a quantitative morphological assessment of the stream reach which provides greater detail from data collected in the field for the implementation into land management decisions.Level III describes the existing condition of a stream as it relates to its stability, response potential, and function. This level includes additional measurements such as, sediment supply, channel stability, and flow regime which further describe the condition or “state” of the stream.Level IV verifies the process relationships inferred from the previous three levels of classification. The objective of this level is to determine empirical relationships for use in prediction (e.g. to develop Manning's n values from measured velocity)The Rosgen Stream Classification is probably best applied as a communication tool to describe channel form. Other uses for the Rosgen Stream Classification include fish habitat indices, surveys of riparian communities, stream restoration and mitigation, engineering, evaluating livestock grazing related to stream type, and the use of sediment and hydraulic data by stream type.Problems with the use of the Rosgen Stream Classification are encountered with identifying bankfull dimensions, particularly in incising channels and with the mixing of bed and bank sediment into a single population. Its use for engineering design and restoration may be flawed by ignoring some processes governed by force and resistance, and the imbalance between sediment supply and transporting power in unstable systemsLimitations for Level II classification involve time dependence, uncertain applicability across physical environments, difficulty in identification of a true equilibrium condition, and uncertain process significance of classification criteria. Implications of using the Rosgen Stream Classification, include: (1) acceptance of the limitations, (2) acceptance of the risk of classifying streams incorrectly, and (3) classification results may be used inappropriately\n",

        "doc": "The Jebel Akhdar  is a heavily forested, fertile upland area in northeastern Libya.  It is located in the modern shabiyahs or districts of Derna, Jabal al Akhdar, and Marj.\nThe Jebel Akhdar consists of a mountainous plateau rising to an altitude of 900 metres (3,000 ft), cut by several valleys and wadis.  It forms the north-western part of the peninsula that sticks north into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Gulf of Sidra on the west, and the Levantine Basin on the east. It runs from Bengazi eastward to just east of Derna, fronting the coast for about 330 kilometres (210 mi). Due to erosion and deposition, the plateau is sometimes as much as 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from the shore, but it forms cliffs on the headlands. The final uplift and arching of the plateau was completed in the Miocene.The region is one of the very few forested areas of Libya, which taken as a whole is one of the least forested countries on Earth. The Jebel Akhdar is the wettest part of Libya, receiving some 600 millimetres (24 in) of precipitation annually. The high rainfall contributes to the area's large forests containing Chammari, and enables rich fruit, potato, and cereal agriculture, something of a rarity in an arid country like Libya. Camels, goats and sheep are herded in and around the Jebel Akhdar and the herders tend to be nomadic.\nIn marked contrast to the aridity prevailing in most of Libya, there are forested areas in this region totalling around 3200 km2, although approximately a third of the original forest has already been destroyed to make way for agriculture. In addition to the forests there are also large areas of maquis and steppe-like vegetation. Typical maquis species are the Phoenician juniper (Juniperus phoenicea), the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus), the Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera) and the carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua). In the drier steppe-like areas, branched asphodel (Asphodelus ramosus), prickly burnet (Sarcopoterium spinosum) and white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) predominate.More than half of the endemic plant species in Libya are to be found in the Jebel Akhdar and, of these, seven are found only in the region: Arbutus pavarii, Arum cyrenaicum, Bellis sylvestris var. cyrenaica, Cyclamen rohlfsianum, Cynara cyrenaica, Onopordum cyrenaicum and Romulea cyrenaica.\nDocuments created during the New Kingdom of Egypt record that to the west there were large populations of metal workers who lived in towns and had plentiful livestock. The only plausible location for these \"Libyans\" is the Jebel Akhdar.The ancient Greek colony of Cyrene was located in a lush valley in the Jebel Akhdar, with the ruins remaining. It was the Greeks who introduced farming to the Jebal Akhdar when they colonised its verdant valleys in around 600 BC.\nDuring the Italian occupation these mountains were identified as a promising area for agriculture and many Italians moved here in the 1930s. This settlement was interrupted during World War II and the villages and farms were deserted and were later reoccupied by Libyans.  The mountain chain was the site of major battles between the British Commonwealth and the Axis forces during World War II.The Libyan leader Omar al-Mukhtar used this heavily forested mountainous region to resist the Italian colonization of Libya for more than twenty years.",

A new two-volume edition was published in 1690, with the addition of volume 2, which also included Bavarian monasteries, abbeys, provostries and convents. The copperplate engravings are by Johann Ulrich Krauß (1655-1719). The Munich jurist Anton Wilhelm Ertl (1654-1715) - at this time chief judge of Steingaden Abbey in Wiedergeltingen - wrote the text. Further editions were published in 1698, 1703, and 1705.\n",

        "doc": "William Pattison's four traditions of geography, often referred to as just the four traditions of geography, are a proposed way to organize the various competing themes and approaches within geography. Proposed in a 1964 article in the Journal of Geography to address criticism that geography was undisciplined and calls for definitions of the scope of geography as a discipline that had been ongoing for at least half a century, the four traditions of geography propose that American geographers work was consistent, but fit into four distinct traditions rather than one overarching definition. The original traditions proposed by Pattison are the spatial tradition, the area studies tradition, the Man-Land tradition, and the Earth science tradition. A theme among these traditions is interconnectedness, and it has been referenced in relation to the Tobler's first law of geography.\nThe four traditions of geography have been widely used to teach geography in the classroom as a compromise between a single definition and memorization of many distinct sub-themes. There are many competing methods to organize geography. The original four traditions have had several proposed changes.\nThe spatial or locational tradition is concerned with employing quantitative methods to describe the spatial characteristics of a location. The spatial tradition seeks to use the spatial characteristics of a location or phenomena to understand and explain it. The contributors to this tradition were historically cartographers, but it now encompasses what we call technical geography and geographic information science.The area studies or regional tradition is concerned with the description of the unique characteristics of the earth's surface, resulting in each area from the combination of its complete natural or elements, as of physical and human environment. The main aim is to understand, or define the uniqueness, or character of a particular region that consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization, which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation into regions.The Human Environment Interaction tradition (originally the Man-Land), also known as Integrated geography, is concerned with the description of the spatial interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the traditional aspects of physical and human geography, like how human societies conceptualize the environment. Integrated geography has emerged as a bridge between human and physical geography due to the increasing specialization of the two sub-fields, or branches.The Earth science tradition is largely concerned with what is generally referred to as physical geography. The tradition focuses on understanding the spatial characteristics of natural phenomena. Some argue the Earth science tradition is a subset of the spatial tradition, however, the two are different enough in their focus and objectives to warrant separation.One of the most contentious terms is the \"man-land tradition.\" This has been largely replaced by the term \"human-environment interaction\" or integrated geography. The Area studies tradition is also called the \"regional\" tradition.Pattison's Four Traditions of Geography have significantly influenced the structure of geographic inquiry. This framework has provided a foundation for organizing and understanding the diverse methodologies and approaches within the field. Scholars and students continue to engage with these traditions, contributing to ongoing debates and advancements in geographical research.While widely embraced, the Four Traditions have not been without criticism. Some scholars argue for a more integrated and interdisciplinary approach that transcends the boundaries of these traditions. Additionally, ongoing developments in technology, globalization, and environmental concerns have prompted discussions on potential expansions or revisions to accommodate contemporary challenges.There are many other methods for organizing geography, including three branches proposed in the UNESCO Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems, which consist of physical geography, human geography, and technical geography.\n",

        "doc": "The five themes of geography are an educational tool for teaching geography. The five themes were published in 1984 and widely adopted by teachers, textbook publishers, and curriculum designers in the United States. Most American geography and social studies classrooms have adopted the five themes in teaching practices, as they provide \"an alternative to the detrimental, but unfortunately persistent, habit of teaching geography through rote memorization\". They are pedagogical themes that guide how geographic content should be taught in schools.\nFive Themes of geography:Location\nPlace\nHuman-Environment Interaction\nMovement\nRegion\nEvery point on Earth has a location. Location can be described in two different ways:Absolute location, a location as described by its latitude and longitude on the Earth. For example, the coordinates of Albany, New York are 42.6525° N, 73.7572° W.\nRelative location, a location as described by where it is compared to something else. For example, Albany, New York is roughly 140 miles north of New York City.\nEvery site on Earth has a unique absolute location, which can be identified with a reference grid (such as latitude and longitude). Maps and globes can be used to find location and can also be used to convey other types of geographical information. Map projections are used to represent the three-dimensional Earth on a two-dimensional map. The Earth's position relative to the Sun affects climate, seasons, and time zones. Location as a theme helps teachers to demonstrate to students that observers have to know and be able to explain where something is before it can be examined geographically. It allows the examination of spatial relationships using spatial ideas such as distance, direction, adjacency, proximity, and enclosure.\nA place is an area that is defined by everything in it. It differs from location in that a place is conditions and features, and location is a position in space. Places have physical characteristics, such as landforms and plant and animal life, as well as human characteristics, such as economic activities and languages. All places have features that give them personality and distinguish them from other places. It is a combination of the “features, perceptions, and activities that occur in a given location\".Toponym: a place name, especially one derived from a topographical feature.\nSite: an area of ground on which a town, building, or monument is constructed.\nSituation: the location and surroundings of a place.\nPopulation: the number of people that live in the area.\nThis theme describes how people interact with the environment, and how the environment responds, with three key concepts:Dependency: Humans depend on the environment.\nAdaptation: Humans adapt to the environment.\nModification: Humans modify the environment.\nSub-themes include \"the earth as an environmental system\" (including the role and problems of technology, environmental hazards and limits, and adaptation) and \"ethics and values\" (differing cultural values and the trade-off between economic development and environmental protection). In the original 1984 Guidelines for Geographic Education: Elementary and Secondary Schools, this was called “relationships within places\". It focused on the advantages and disadvantages for human settlement in places. It was later renamed to human-environment interaction. This theme is not exclusive to geography, as it is a goal for many disciplines of study.\nMovement is the travel of people, goods, and ideas from one location to another. Examples of movement include the United States' westward expansion, the Information Revolution, and immigration. New devices such as the airplane and the Internet allow physical and ideological goods to be transferred long distances in short time intervals. A person's travel from place to place, and the actions they perform there are also considered movement.Places are connected by movement:\nMethods of transportation (transportation geography) : public transportation, private transportation, freight transportation\nMovement in everyday life\nHistory of movement\nEconomic factors influencing movement\nEnergy or mass induced movement : the water cycle, tectonic plates, movements within ecosystems, etc.\nGlobal interdependence\nModels of human interaction, including gravity models and central place theory\nIn the original 1984 Guidelines for Geographic Education: Elementary and Secondary Schools document, movement was called “relationships between places\". Transportation routes and telephone lines that link people all over the world are visible examples of relationships between places.\nRegions are areas with distinctive characteristics: human characteristics, such as demographics or politics, and physical characteristics, such as climate and vegetation. For example, the US is a political region because it shares one governmental system.Regions may have clear, well-defined borders or vague boundaries.\nUniform region : \"defined by some uniform cultural or physical characteristic\", such as the Bible Belt or New England\nFunctional region : space organized around a focal point, such as a metropolitan area or around the flow of something, like the water of the Amazon Basin, or the flow of travelers in an airport\nCultural diversity : regions are a way to understand human diversity.\nUniform regions and formal regions share a similar definition, with formal regions being “a group of places that have similar conditions\". Even in formal regions, it is true that no region is completely homogeneous, as characteristics vary from place to place. While regions all share at least one common trait, it is true that they can have multiple traits that unite them, an example being a region that shares a language and a government.\nThe five themes of geography were published in the 1984 Guidelines for Geographic Education: Elementary and Secondary Schools by the National Council for Geographic Education/Association of American Geographers Joint Committee on Geographic Education. The document was 28 pages, and suggested the themes as a way for teachers to organize content for geography classes. The committee included Salvatore J. Natoli, Richard G. Boehm, James B. Kracht, David A. Lanegran, Janice J. Monk, and Robert W. Morrill. They settled on five themes: location, place, relationships within places (later changed to human-environment interaction), relationships between places (later shortened to movement), and region. The themes were not a \"new geography\" but rather a conceptual structure for organizing information about geography.The themes became widespread in American social science education and were used for teacher training by the National Geographic Society's statewide alliances. They also played a role in reestablishing geography in school curricula. When the National Geography Standards were released in 1994, people compared them to the five themes, saying that the themes had a simplicity that the new standards were lacking.\nIn 1992, a National Assessment of Educational Progress consensus group said that the five themes are useful for teaching, but that for assessment, geography should be divided into the three topics of \"space and place\", \"environment and society\", and \"spatial dynamic and connections\".\nThe five themes continue to be used as an educational approach in many educational outlets. As of 2012, they are included in the National Council for the Social Studies elementary school standards and in state social studies standards.\nThe five themes continue to be used as an educational approach in many educational outlets. As of 2012, they are included in the National Council for the Social Studies elementary school standards and in state social studies standards. The influence of the five themes can still be found in many standards, such as the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) Standards for elementary grades. With the increase of emphasis placed on standardized testing in the United States, social studies, and thus geography, is receiving less time in elementary classrooms.",

Changes in land systems have large consequences for the local environment and human well-being and are at the same time pervasive factors of global environmental change. Land provides vital resources to society, such as food, fuel, fibres and many other ecosystem services that support production functions, regulate risks of natural hazards, or provide cultural and spiritual services.  By using the land, society alters and modifies the quantity and quality of the provision of these services.\nLand system changes are the direct result of human decision making at multiple scales ranging from local land owners decisions to national scale land use planning and global trade agreements. The aggregate impact of many local land system changes has far reaching consequences for the Earth System, that feedback on ecosystem services, human well-being and decision making. As a consequence, land system change is both a cause and consequence of socio-ecological processes.\nThe Global Land Programme (GLP) of Future Earth is an interdisciplinary community of science and practice fostering the study of land systems and the co-design of solutions for global sustainability.\n",
