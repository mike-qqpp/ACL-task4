        "doc": "The Age of Sail is a period in European history that lasted at the latest from the mid-16th (or mid-15th) to the mid-19th centuries, in which the dominance of sailing ships in global trade and warfare culminated, particularly marked by the introduction of naval artillery, and ultimately reached its highest extent at the advent of steam power. Enabled by the advances of the related Age of Navigation, it is identified as a distinctive element of the early modern period and the Age of Discovery.\nLike most periodic eras, defining the age is inexact and serves only as a general description. The term is used differently for warships and merchant vessels.By the 14th century naval artillery was employed in Europe, documented at the Battle of Arnemuiden (1338). The 15th century saw the Iberian naval ventures all the way along the African Atlantic coast and across the Atlantic Ocean, starting the Age of Discovery.\nFor warships, the age of sail runs roughly from the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the last significant engagement in which oar-propelled galleys played a major role, to the development of steam-powered warships.\nThe period between the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity (e.g. clippers and windjammers), is sometimes referred to as the \"Golden Age of Sail\".The second sea-going steamboat was Richard Wright's first steamboat Experiment, an ex-French lugger; she steamed from Leeds to Yarmouth in July 1813. The first iron steamship to go to sea was the 116-ton Aaron Manby, built in 1821 by Aaron Manby at the Horseley Ironworks, and became the first iron-built vessel to put to sea when she crossed the English Channel in 1822, arriving in Paris on 22 June. She carried passengers and freight to Paris in 1822 at an average speed of 8 knots (9 mph, 14 km/h). The first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun Napoléon in 1850. Multiple steam battleships saw action during the Crimean War, especially the Allied (British, French and Ottoman) fleet Bombardment of Sevastopol as part of the Siege of Sevastopol (1854:1855). The first ironclad battleship, Gloire, was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. In the March 1862 Battle of Hampton Roads, the ironclad CSS Virginia fought USS Monitor, making this the first fight between ironclads.\nThe Suez Canal in the Middle East, which opened in 1869, was more practical for steamships than for sailing ships, achieving a much shorter European-Asian sea route, which coincided with more fuel-efficient steamships, starting with Agamemnon in 1865.\nBy 1873, the Age of Sail for warships had ended, with HMS Devastation commissioned in 1871. Devastation was the first class of ocean-going battleships that did not carry sails.\nSailing ships continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s and 1930s, though steamships soon pushed them out of those trades as well. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from sophisticated dedicated support bases on land. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following trade winds. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in a fraction of the time it took a sailing ship.\nSailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small-scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as yachting and passenger sail excursion ships.\nIn recent decades, the commercial shipping industry has been reviving interest in wind assisted ships as a way to conserve fuel in the interest of sustainability.\nA New Age of Sail has been predicted by some experts to occur by 2030, driven by a revolution in energy technology and a desire to reduce carbon emissions from maritime shipping through wind-assisted propulsion. The book Trade Winds: A Voyage to a Sustainable Future for Shipping discusses the potential of a return to wind propulsion through the firsthand experiences of Christiaan De Beukelaer, who spent five months aboard a sailing cargo ship in 2020.",

        "title": "Mathematician",
        "doc": "A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in their work, typically to solve mathematical problems. Mathematicians are concerned with numbers, data, quantity, structure, space, models, and change.\nOne of the earliest known mathematicians was Thales of Miletus (c. 624 : c. 546 BC); he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales's theorem.The number of known mathematicians grew when Pythagoras of Samos (c. 582 : c. 507 BC) established the Pythagorean school, whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was \"All is number\". It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term \"mathematics\", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins.\nThe first woman mathematician recorded by history was Hypatia of Alexandria (c. AD 350 : 415). She succeeded her father as librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).\nScience and mathematics in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs, and it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated, and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was Al-Khawarizmi. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths. Examples include the work on optics, maths and astronomy of Ibn al-Haytham.\nThe Renaissance brought an increased emphasis on mathematics and science to Europe. During this period of transition from a mainly feudal and ecclesiastical culture to a predominantly secular one, many notable mathematicians had other occupations: Luca Pacioli (founder of accounting); Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia (notable engineer and bookkeeper); Gerolamo Cardano (earliest founder of probability and binomial expansion); Robert Recorde (physician) and François Viète (lawyer).\nAs time passed, many mathematicians gravitated towards universities. An emphasis on free thinking and experimentation had begun in Britain's oldest universities beginning in the seventeenth century at Oxford with the scientists Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle, and at Cambridge where Isaac Newton was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics & Physics. Moving into the 19th century, the objective of universities all across Europe evolved from teaching the \"regurgitation of knowledge\" to \"encourag[ing] productive thinking.\" In 1810, Alexander von Humboldt convinced the king of Prussia, Fredrick William III, to build a university in Berlin based on Friedrich Schleiermacher's liberal ideas; the goal was to demonstrate the process of the discovery of knowledge and to teach students to \"take account of fundamental laws of science in all their thinking.\" Thus, seminars and laboratories started to evolve.\nBritish universities of this period adopted some approaches familiar to the Italian and German universities, but as they already enjoyed substantial freedoms and autonomy the changes there had begun with the Age of Enlightenment, the same influences that inspired Humboldt. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge emphasized the importance of research, arguably more authentically implementing Humboldt's idea of a university than even German universities, which were subject to state authority. Overall, science (including mathematics) became the focus of universities in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students could conduct research in seminars or laboratories and began to produce doctoral theses with more scientific content. According to Humboldt, the mission of the University of Berlin was to pursue scientific knowledge. The German university system fostered professional, bureaucratically regulated scientific research performed in well-equipped laboratories, instead of the kind of research done by private and individual scholars in Great Britain and France. In fact, Rüegg asserts that the German system is responsible for the development of the modern research university because it focused on the idea of \"freedom of scientific research, teaching and study.\"\nMathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their undergraduate education, and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the graduate level. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of mathematics; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation.",

        "doc": "Ethics in mathematics is an emerging field of applied ethics, the inquiry into ethical aspects of the practice and applications of mathematics. It deals with the professional responsibilities of mathematicians whose work influences decisions with major consequences, such as in law, finance, the military, and environmental science. When understood in its socio-economic context, the development of mathematical works can lead to ethical questions ranging from the handling and manipulation of big data to questions of responsible mathematisation and falsification of models, explainable and safe mathematics, as well as many issues related to communication and documentation. The usefulness of a Hippocratic oath for mathematicians is an issue of ongoing debate among scholars. As an emerging field of applied ethics, many of its foundations are still highly debated. The discourse remains in flux. Especially the notion that mathematics can do harm remains controversial.\nThe ethical questions surrounding the practice of mathematics can be connected to issues of dual-use. An instrumental interpretation of the impact of mathematics makes it difficult to see ethical consequences, yet it might be easier to see how all branches of mathematics serve to structure and conceptualize solutions to real problems. These structures can set up perverse incentives, where targets can be met without improving services, or league table positions are gamed. While the assumptions written into metrics often reflect the worldview of the groups who are responsible for designing them, they are harder for non-experts to challenge, leading to injustices. As mathematicians can enter the workforce of industrialised nations in many places that are no longer limited to teaching and academia, scholars have made the argument that it is necessary to add ethical training into the mathematical curricula at universities.\nThe philosophical positions on the relationship between mathematics and ethics are varied. Some philosophers (e.g. Plato) see both mathematics and ethics as rational and similar, while others (e.g. Rudolf Carnap) see ethics as irrational and different from mathematics. Possible tensions between applying mathematics in a social context and its ethics can already be observed in Plato's Republic (Book VIII) where the use of mathematics to produce better guardians plays a critical role in its collapse.",

At the age of 9, his family moved to Mombasa, Kenya and he pursued his schooling in Kenya. He completed his degree in mathematics at the University of Leicester. After completing his degree, he worked as a school teacher for six years in Kenya and, then he did a master's degree at the University of Manchester, England. He qualified in Law in 2000. G. G. Joseph studied and conducted researches in applied mathematics and statistics, including multivariate analysis, mathematical programming, and demography. He is conducting three-month research on the history of mathematics in his native place every year. Through his series of researches, he argued that the infinite series was invented by Kerala mathematicians in 1350, before Europeans.\n",

        "title": "Akira_Yoshizawa",
        "doc": "Akira Yoshizawa (Yoshizawa Akira, 14 March 1911 : 14 March 2005) was a Japanese origamist, considered to be the grandmaster of origami. He is credited with raising origami from a craft to a living art. According to his own estimation made in 1989, he created more than 50,000 models, of which only a few hundred designs were presented as diagrams in his 18 books. Yoshizawa acted as an international cultural ambassador for Japan throughout his career. In 1983, Emperor Hirohito awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun, 5th class, one of the highest honors bestowed in Japan.\nYoshizawa was born on 14th March 1911, in Kaminokawa, Japan, to the family of a dairy farmer. When he was a child, he took pleasure in teaching himself origami. He moved into a factory job in Tokyo when he was 13 years old. His passion for origami was rekindled in his early 20s, when he was promoted from factory worker to technical draftsman. His new job was to teach junior employees geometry. Yoshizawa used the traditional art of origami to understand and communicate geometrical problems.In 1937, he left factory work to pursue origami full-time. During the next 20 years, he lived in total poverty, earning his living by door-to-door selling of tsukudani (a Japanese preserved condiment that is usually made of seaweed). During World War II, Yoshizawa served in the army medical corps in Hong Kong. He made origami models to cheer up the sick patients, but eventually fell ill himself and was sent back to Japan.  His origami work was creative enough to be included in the 1944 book Origami Shuko, by Isao Honda (本多 功). However, it was his work for the January 1952 issue of the magazine Asahi Graph that launched his career, which included the 12 zodiac signs commissioned by a magazine.\nIn 1954, his first monograph, Atarashii Origami Geijutsu (New Origami Art) was published. In this work, he established the Yoshizawa:Randlett system of notation for origami folds (a system of symbols, arrows and diagrams), which has become the standard for most paperfolders. The publishing of this book helped Yoshizawa out of his poverty. It was followed closely by his founding of the International Origami Centre in Tokyo in 1954, when he was 43.\nHis first overseas exhibition was organized in October 1955 by Gershon Legman, a leading player in the early years of the origami movement. The exhibition was held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Felix Tikotin, a Dutch dealer, acted as a liaison.\nYoshizawa lent many of his own origami models to other exhibitions around the world. He would never sell his origami figures, but rather gave them away as gifts to people, and let other groups and organizations borrow them for exhibiting.\nHis second wife, Kiyo Yoshizawa, served as his manager and taught origami to the other patients where he was hospitalized until his death.\nAlthough Yoshizawa pioneered many different origami techniques, wet-folding is one of his most significant contributions. This technique involves slightly dampening the paper before making a fold. Wet-folding allows the paper to be manipulated more easily, resulting in finished origami models that have a rounder and more sculpted look.Wet-folding is most often used with thicker paper; normal origami paper is very thin and thus prone to tearing when using the wet-folding technique. Yoshizawa believed the process was the most important part. He was known to say that, \"When you fold, the ritual and the act of creation is more important than the final result. When your hands are busy your heart is serene\".\nIn March 1998, Yoshizawa was invited to exhibit his origami in the Carrousel du Louvre in France. Although he had previously disliked his contemporaries, he was not opposed to having his photo taken with them. Many of his patterns had been diagrammed by his professional rivals, which angered Yoshizawa when he was younger. However, as he had aged, he found that he now enjoyed the company of his peers.Yoshizawa died on 14 March 2005 in a hospital in Itabashi, Tokyo, of complications from pneumonia, on his 94th birthday.\nAfter his death, he was featured in Between the Folds, a documentary about origami that called him the father of modern, sculptural approaches to origami.\n",

        "doc": "Mathematical diagrams, such as charts and graphs, are mainly designed to convey mathematical relationships—for example, comparisons over time.\nA complex number can be visually represented as a pair of numbers forming a vector on a diagram called an Argand diagramThe complex plane is sometimes called the Argand plane because it is used in Argand diagrams. These are named after Jean-Robert Argand (1768:1822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician Caspar Wessel (1745:1818). Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the poles and zeroes of a function in the complex plane.\nThe concept of the complex plane allows a geometric interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in polar coordinates — the magnitude or modulus of the product is the product of the two absolute values, or moduli, and the angle or argument of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.\nIn the context of fast Fourier transform algorithms, a butterfly is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms). The name \"butterfly\" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below. The same structure can also be found in the Viterbi algorithm, used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.The butterfly diagram show a data-flow diagram connecting the inputs x (left) to the outputs y that depend on them (right) for a \"butterfly\" step of a radix-2 Cooley:Tukey FFT algorithm. This diagram resembles a butterfly as in the Morpho butterfly shown for comparison, hence the name.\nIn mathematics, and especially in category theory, a commutative diagram is a diagram of objects, also known as vertices, and morphisms, also known as arrows or edges, such that when selecting two objects any directed path through the diagram leads to the same result by composition.Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.\nA Hasse diagram is a simple picture of a finite partially ordered set, forming a drawing of the partial order's transitive reduction. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from x to y precisely when x < y and there is no z such that x < z < y. In this case, we say y covers x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.In Knot theory a useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—;think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small perturbation in the choice of projection will ensure that it is one-to-one except at the double points, called crossings, where the \"shadow\" of the knot crosses itself once transverselyAt each crossing we must indicate which section is \"over\" and which is \"under\", so as to be able to recreate the original knot. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. If by following the diagram the knot alternately crosses itself \"over\" and \"under\", then the diagram represents a particularly well-studied class of knot, alternating knots.\nA Venn diagram is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.The Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is not null.\nA Voronoi diagram is a special kind of decomposition of a metric space determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space, e.g., by a discrete set of points. This diagram is named after Georgy Voronoi, also called a Voronoi tessellation, a Voronoi decomposition, or a Dirichlet tessellation after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.In the simplest case, we are given a set of points S in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site s has a Voronoi cell V(s) consisting of all points closer to s than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to two sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites\nA wallpaper group or plane symmetry group or plane crystallographic group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct groups.Wallpaper groups are two-dimensional symmetry groups, intermediate in complexity between the simpler frieze groups and the three-dimensional crystallographic groups, also called space groups. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group.\nA Young diagram or Young tableau, also called Ferrers diagram, is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row sizes weakly decreasing (each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor).

        "doc": "A people is any plurality of persons considered as a whole. Used in politics and law, the term \"a people\" refers to the collective or community of an ethnic group or nation. The term \"the people\" refers to the public or common mass of people of a polity. As such it is a concept of human rights law, international law as well as constitutional law, particularly used for claims of popular sovereignty.\nChapter One, Article One of the Charter of the United Nations states that \"peoples\" have the right to self-determination. Though the mere status as peoples and the right to self-determination, as for example in the case of Indigenous peoples (peoples, as in all groups of indigenous people, not merely all indigenous persons as in indigenous people), does not automatically provide for independent sovereignty and therefore secession. Indeed, judge Ivor Jennings identified the inherent problems in the right of \"peoples\" to self-determination, as it requires pre-defining a said \"people\".Both the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire used the Latin term Senatus Populusque Romanus, (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed abbreviated (SPQR) to Roman legionary standards, and even after the Roman Emperors achieved a state of total personal autocracy, they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.The term People's Republic, used since late modernity, is a name used by states, which particularly  identify constitutionally with a form of socialism.\nIn criminal law, in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the People. Several U.S. states, including California, Illinois, and New York, use this style. Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words \"the People\" in the case captions. Four states — Massachusetts, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky — refer to themselves as the Commonwealth in case captions and legal process.  Other states, such as Indiana, typically refer to themselves as the State in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in Ireland and the Philippines are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the sovereign; thus, in these U.S. states, the \"people\" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the United Kingdom and other dependencies of the British Crown, criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of the Crown. \"The people\" identifies the entire body of the citizens of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.\n",

        "doc": "Section Eleven of the Constitution of South Africa, part of the Bill of Rights, guarantees the right to life. This section has been interpreted to prohibit the death penalty, but not to prohibit abortion. It also has important implications for euthanasia, self-defence, the use of force by law enforcement, and the provision of life-saving healthcare.\nUnder the heading \"Life\", the section states, in full, \"Everyone has the right to life.\" Unlike the right to life in many other human rights instruments, this section is unqualified; it does not make an exception for the death penalty, but neither does it explicitly state that the death penalty is forbidden.\nOne of the first decisions by the Constitutional Court was the 1995 case of S v Makwanyane, in which the court addressed the constitutionality of the death penalty. The principal judgment, by President of the Court Arthur Chaskalson, found the death penalty to be unconstitutional not because it violated the right to life, but because it violated the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment elsewhere in the Bill of Rights. However, a majority of the judges of the court held that the death penalty also violated the right to life.In the 2001 case of Mohamed v President of the Republic of South Africa the Constitutional Court dealt with the extradition of suspects under circumstances where they may face the death penalty. The court held that the South African government cannot extradite suspects for capital offences without obtaining an assurance from the jurisdiction requesting extradition that they will not be sentenced to death (or that, if they are, the death penalty will not be carried out). This was reaffirmed in the 2012 case of Minister of Home Affairs v Tsebe. However these protections do not extend to South African citizens outside South Africa: in Kaunda v President of the Republic of South Africa the court held that the South African government was not obliged to intervene diplomatically to protect South African citizens being extradited from Zimbabwe to Equatorial Guinea on capital charges.\nThe Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1996, which permits elective abortions in the first trimester and for broadly-specified reasons in the second trimester, was challenged in Christian Lawyers' Association v Minister of Health, on the basis that it violated the foetus' right to life. The Transvaal Provincial Division of the High Court dismissed the case, ruling that the word \"everyone\" in section 11 does not extend to unborn foetuses, which do not have legal personality under the Bill of Rights.",

        "doc": "Dilorom Yuldasheva (born ) is an Uzbek woman who overcame disability. She lost her legs in an accident with a combine harvester. She overcame her disability to become a businesswoman employing 40 others. Her example was recognised and she was one of the BBC's 100 Inspiring Women and she was given a national courage award in 2024.\nYuldasheva was married and she worked in the fields in the Denov district of Uzbekistan. She was handfeeding a combine harvester when her long clothes became entangled in the machinery. As a result, she had both her legs amputated and she was immobile as her family could not afford a wheelchair. She told her husband that he should marry again but he told her that she should never raise that matter again.Within two years of the accident she had created a sewing business which employed forty other women. She wanted women to not have to work in the fields. She organised training and obtained contracts so that they could create uniforms for businesses and schools.\nYuldasheva received visits from people who offered their sympathies and they would take their selfies with her. The visitors brought a chair and a make-up box which they used in the photos. It was a week later that she learned that the chair actually belonged to a local elderly woman. She returned the chair and the make-up box was retrieved. She became resigned to the exploitation but she noted her own disappointment at losing the chair as she had been temporarly mobile. Even with a chair she  could not travel far as her family live over a mile from a road and that path needs to be covered before the start of any car journey. The dresses that she makes are delivered by her son on his bicycle.\nIn 2024 she was recognised as one of the BBC's 100 inspiring women for 2024. As a result, she also received a national \"Mardlik\" courage award in December 2024, in a meeting chaired by the President. The President's daughter and assistant Saida Mirziyoyeva was tasked with making a film about Yuldosheva, and at least four more, in 2025. The President announced wide-ranging targets to improve the support for those with disabilities. Yuldosheva thanked the President for his help and for continuing to deliver peace.\n",

        "title": "Master–slave_(technology)",
        "doc": "In engineering, master:slave is a relationship between two systems in which one controls the other. In some cases one master controls just one slave system, but in others there are multiple slave systems controlled by the same master. Sometimes the master is a different kind of system than the slave, but sometimes there are multiple similar systems and one of them is designated the master in order to centralize external (i.e. user) control of the collection.\nDue to its connection to slavery, the terminology is a subject of controversy and has been replaced with alternative terms in some cases.\nA master clock provides time signals used to synchronize one or more slave clocks as part of a clock network; a slave clock receives and displays the time from a master; though it may be able to keep time itself if the master is not working.A serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus typically has a single master controlling multiple slaves.\nI2C and I3C are also an example of master-slave technology.\nModbus uses a master device to initiate connection requests to slave devices.\nAn edge-triggered flip-flop can be created by arranging two gated latches in a master:slave configuration. It is so named because the master latch controls the slave latch's value and forces the slave latch to hold its value, as the slave latch always copies its new value from the master latch.\nIn photography, secondary, or slave, flash units are connected to a master unit to provide synchronized lighting.\nParallel audio duplication often entails multiple recording devices (i.e. for cassette tape or compact disc) linked together so that operating the controls of a master device triggers the same commands on slave devices.\nRailway locomotives operating in the same train (for example, to pull a load too heavy for a single locomotive) may be configured for master:slave operation with all but one of the locomotives controlled from the first. See Multiple-unit train control.\nIn a hydraulic system, a master cylinder is a control device that converts force into hydraulic pressure that drives movement in a slave cylinder at the other end of the hydraulic line. A common application is a vehicle brake system.\nThe term master is used in many technology contexts that do not refer to a relationship of control. Master may be used to mean a copy that has more significance than other copies in which case the term is an absolute concept; not a relationship. Sometimes the term master-slave is used in contexts that do not imply a controlling relationship.In database replication, the master database is the authoritative source. A replica database, sometimes called a slave, is synchronized to it but is not controlled by it.\nA Parallel ATA (aka IDE) hard drive interface supports two hard drives on a cable, which are designated master and slave. The distinction is required by the interface even though neither drive has control or priority over the other.\nThe master:slave terminology was first used in 1904. The terminology was used in 1988 for RFC 1059 and in 1997 for RFC 2136, related to the domain name system. In 2020, Paul Vixie commented on his choice of words:\nI introduced the master/slave terminology in RFC 2136, because I needed names for the roles in an AXFR/IXFR transaction, and the zone transfer hierarchy could be more than one layer deep, such that a server might initiate some AXFR/IXFR's to the \"primary master\" but then respond to AXFR/IXFR's from other servers. In retrospect I should have chosen the terms, \"transfer initiator\" and \"transfer responder\". However, the hydraulic brake and clutch systems in my car had \"master cylinders\" and \"slave cylinders\", and so I did not think I was either inventing a new use for the words \"master\" and \"slave\", or that my use of them for this purpose would be controversial.\nSaid hydraulic brakes for the automotive industry were patented in 1917 by Malcolm Loughead. The term slave cylinder was used in other patent applications, including one by Robert Esnault-Pelterie, published in 1919.\n",

        "doc": "Jesús García Corona (13 November 1881 : 7 November 1907) was a Mexican railroad brakeman who died while preventing a train loaded with dynamite from exploding near Nacozari, Sonora, in 1907. As \"el héroe de Nacozari\", he is revered as a national hero and many streets, plazas, and schools across Mexico are named after him.\nGarcía was born in Hermosillo, Sonora. He was one of eight children. At the age of 17 he got a job with Moctezuma Copper Company, but due to his age, he was made a waterboy. He was promoted to switchman, then to brakeman and eventually to fireman.Jesús García was the railroad brakeman for the train that covered the line between Nacozari, Sonora, and Douglas, Arizona. On 7 November 1907 the train was stopped in the town and, as he was resting, he saw that some hay on the roof of a car containing dynamite had caught fire. The cause of the fire was that the locomotive's smokebox was failing and sparks were going out from the smokestack. The wind blew them and got into the dynamite cars. García drove the train in reverse downhill at full-steam six kilometers out of the town before the dynamite exploded, killing him and sparing the population of the mining town.In his honor a statue was raised and the name of the town of Nacozari was changed to Nacozari de García. He was declared Hero of Humanity by the American Red Cross, many streets in Mexico carry his name, and the Estadio Héroe de Nacozari sports stadium in Hermosillo is also named after him. García's sacrifice is remembered in the corrido (ballad) \"Máquina 501\", sung by Pancho \"el Charro\" Avitia, and Mexican railroad workers commemorate 7 November every year as the Día del Ferrocarrilero (Railroader's Day). His heroism is also recounted in the ballad, \"Jesus Garcia\" sung by Arizona State's official balladeer, Dolan Ellis, who wanted to let the world know of the \"Casey Jones of Mexico\" who saved the town. García was awarded, posthumously, the American Cross of Honor.",

        "doc": "The coat of arms of the Prince of Wales is the official personal heraldic insignia of the Princes of Wales, a title traditionally granted to the heir apparent of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, formerly the Kingdom of Great Britain and before that the Kingdom of England. \nThe coat of arms devised for Charles III, then Prince of Wales, in 1958, were the same as his granduncle, Edward VIII, had used as prince of Wales since 1911 (see below for references), and contained the badges and elements taken from all four of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom as well as from the many titles the prince holds as heir apparent. These arms lapsed when Charles became king.\nSince Edward I awarded it to his son the future Edward II, the heir apparent to the English throne has been created with the title Prince of Wales. William was so created by Charles III on the 2nd day of his reign. The College of Arms has yet to assign William, and Charles III has yet to settle on William by royal warrant, a version of the royal arms that depicts elements of his title as prince of Wales.\nThe history of the coat of arms is closely linked with those of the Coat of arms of England and the Coat of arms of the United Kingdom. However, as the noted antiquarian and heraldist Charles Boutell wrote in 1863, \"The Arms of the Prince of Wales have a distinct individuality of their own, with which nothing ought to be directly associated\".\nThe coronets of the Prince and the Peers of the realm were regulated by Charles II by Royal Warrant, signed on 9 February 1661. Part of the warrant proclaimed: \"Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That the Son and Heir Apparent of the Crown for the time being, shall use and bear his Coronet composed of Crosses and Flower-de-Lized with one Arch; and in the midst a Ball and Cross, as hath our Royal Diadem\".In other words, the heraldic coronet used in the Prince of Wales's coat of arms is similar to the heraldic crown used in the Royal arms, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only one. Boutell wrote that: \"It should be noticed, however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales\". The coronet is also used by the Prince of Wales's consort, in her coat of arms.\nThe heir's coronet was confirmed in another Royal Warrant signed on 19 November 1917 by George V. The warrant proclaimed: \"by the son and heir apparent of the sovereign and his successors a coronet composed of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and in the midst a ball and cross as in the royal crown.\"\nCurrently there are three physical examples of coronets used at one time or other as part of the Honours of the Principality of Wales: the Coronet of Frederick, the Coronet of George and the Coronet of Charles. However, these physical manifestations have not affected the graphical representation of the coronet in heraldic art.\nBeginning with the reign of Edward I, a label of three points Azure (or blue) was used by his son, the future Edward II, to differentiate his arms from those of his father. Without such a label their arms would be identical. Within heraldry this system of differentiating arms is called cadency. The label is placed on the chief (or top) of the shield of arms, with the ends extending across from the dexter to the sinister sides of the shield. It was Edward the Black Prince, heir of Edward III, who first used a label of three points Argent, also white or silver. This has been the label of the heir apparent ever since, without regard to the system of cadency used by other members of the royal family.The Prince of Wales's crest follows closely that of the Sovereign, but always with the appropriate label of difference displayed. This crest depicts a \"Lion Or, passant guardant, wearing a coronet of the Heir, and differenced on the shoulders with a label of three points Argent.\" The lion always stands on a larger coronet of the Heir, which then sits on a golden helmet or the Royal Helm. From the sides flow the gold and ermine mantling of the royal family.Similarly to the crest, the prince's supporters follow those of the Sovereign. On either side of the shield of arms and standing on gold scrollwork are the royal supporters: the Lion and the Unicorn. Both beasts have the prince's label charged around their necks, again as an appropriate mark of difference. The lion on the dexter side, an ancient symbol of England, is crowned with the coronet of the Heir. The beast has been a supporter of the English royal arms since the reign of Henry VIII. The white unicorn of Scotland on the sinister side was incorporated into the royal arms from the Scottish royal arms after the Union of the crowns in 1603.Prince William was appointed a Knight of the Garter in 2008. Since the founding of the Order in 1348, almost every Prince of Wales has been appointed to the Order. The Order of the Garter is represented in the coat of arms by its namesake the blue buckled garter, which bears in gold letters the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense, middle French for \"Shame on him who thinks evil of it\".Under the coat of arms is a scroll bearing the motto Ich dien, German for \"I serve\". The motto of uncertain origin first appeared on the arms of Edward of Woodstock ('The Black Prince'). Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales by his father Edward III on 12 May 1343. Legend holds that the Black Prince took the motto as well as the ostrich feathers from John the Blind of Bohemia, who was killed fighting against the prince and his father at the Battle of Crécy in 1346. The motto is also a near homophone for Eich Dyn, \"Your Man\" in Welsh.The Prince of Wales as part of his full achievement of arms has many Heraldic badges, which represent the history and sovereignty of his many titles.The Prince of Wales's feathers badge comprises \"a plume of three ostrich feathers Argent enfiled by a royal coronet of alternate crosses and fleur-de-lys Or\" with the motto Ich dien on a dark blue ribbon. The badge is probably the most recognisable element of the Prince of Wales's heraldic achievement as a personal insignia of the prince and also of the Principality of Wales itself. In a personal capacity the badge is granted as a royal warrant of appointment to companies that regularly supply goods and services to the Prince. As of 2018 there were 170 companies entitled to display this badge with the words \"By Appointment to HRH The Prince of Wales\" underneath. The badge can be depicted on all premises, delivery vehicles, stationery and advertisements as well as on the individual products themselves. Other organisations associated with Wales or the Prince incorporate the badge into their own insignia including many Welsh regiments of the British Army (such as the Royal Regiment of Wales) and the Welsh Rugby Union.Feathers used as either a crest or a badge have been an ancient heraldic badge of the House of Plantagenet. However, it was not until its incorporation into the heraldic achievements of the Black Prince that the feathers have become an omnipresent feature of the coats of arms of the Prince of Wales.\nOn 10 December 1901 a warrant signed by Edward VII approved the addition of a badge of the Red Dragon to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales. The proclamation specified \"on the sinister side a representation of the Badge of Wales, namely, on a mount vert a Dragon, passant gules, differenced (as in the Crest) with a label of three points argent.\" This was to complement the feathers badge, which was to be depicted on the dexter side of the prince's crest.The Red Dragon, or Y Ddraig Goch, has been a symbol associated with Wales since the 7th century. It was not until the beginning of the House of Tudor that the Red Dragon became a royal badge of the kings of England. Henry Tudor (later King Henry VII) displayed the Dragon on his battle standard. The red dragon became an official royal badge of the sovereign (representing Wales) according to a warrant issued in 1801. The warrant at the same time also confirmed the Tudor rose as a royal badge for England, the thistle for Scotland and the golden harp for Ireland.\nThe arms of the Duke of Cornwall are: \"Sable, fifteen bezants, five, four, three, two and one.\" These arms were derived from those of Richard of Cornwall, King of the Romans, son and heir of King John, who was also Count of Poitiers (or Poitou), represented by arms made up of peas (pois) or gold coins.Upon the accession of the prince's mother as Elizabeth II on 6 February 1952, Prince Charles was automatically made the Duke of Cornwall. As such he is able to display the arms of the duchy on his coat of arms. This title has been granted to every heir apparent since 17 March 1337, in accordance with a charter issued by Edward III for his eldest son and heir Edward of Woodstock. A royal warrant of 21 June 1968 augmented this arms with two supporters \"on either side, a Cornish chough proper supporting an ostrich feather Argent, penned Or\", and a motto: \"Houmont\" (or Houmout), meaning courage.\n",

        "doc": "Favorite son (or favorite daughter) is a political term.\nAt the quadrennial American national political party conventions, a state delegation sometimes nominates a presidential candidate from the state, or less often from the state's region, who is not a viable candidate in the view of other delegations, and votes for this candidate in the initial ballot. The technique allows state leaders to negotiate with leading candidates in exchange for the delegation's support in subsequent ballots.\nSerious candidates usually, but not always, avoided campaigning in favorite sons' states. If a party's leader in a state, usually the governor, was unsure of whom to support, as the favorite son the state party could avoid disputes. Conversely, a party leader who has chosen a candidate might become a favorite son to keep other candidates' campaigns out of the state, or prevent a rival local politician from becoming a favorite son. The favorite son may explicitly state that the candidacy is not viable, or that the favorite son is not a candidate at all. The favorite son may hope to receive the vice-presidential nomination, Cabinet post or other job, increase support for the favorite son's region or policies, or just the publicity from being nominated at the convention.\nThe technique was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Since nationwide campaigns by candidates and binding primary elections have replaced brokered conventions, the technique has fallen out of use, as party rule changes in the early 1970s required candidates to have nominations from more than one state.\nA politician whose electoral appeal derives from their native state, rather than their political views is called a \"favorite son\". For example, in the United States, a presidential candidate will usually win the support of their home state(s). A particularly notable instance of this occurred in 1984, when challenger Walter Mondale lost 49 of 50 states against popular incumbent Ronald Reagan, winning only his home state of Minnesota.\n",

        "doc": "Grammar nazi/spelling nazi or grammar pedant/spelling pedant is a term for a pedant who compulsively criticizes or corrects others' grammar mistakes, typos, misspellings, and other errors in speech or writing. The term originated in 1990s discussion forums as a way to insult those who overly correct others' grammar. \"Grammar Nazis\" often correct mistakes humorously, though this can reinforce arbitrary standards of linguistic correctness. These corrections often reflect literacy privilege. The term is often criticized for being a lighthearted use of the word Nazi. Grammar nazis are often criticized themselves for being rude or harsh.\nThe Nazis were the German government and military responsible for the Holocaust during World War II. They were extremely authoritarian. By the 1950s-60s, \"nazi,\" when written in lowercase, became a term for anyone seen as extremely authoritarian. Early examples include \"surf nazis\" who were fanatical about surfing. The term \"grammar nazi\" appeared on a Usenet forum as early as 1990, and gained wider recognition after the \"Soup Nazi\" character on Seinfeld in 1995.With the spread of social media, grammar nazis have become more common, as it is easier than ever to correct typos and misspellings. Grammar nazis are particularly prevalent on Facebook, Reddit, and X (Twitter).In 2016, Reese Lansangan released the song Grammar Nazi about a woman upset with her love interest's grammar. The song went viral and is even used to teach English. The song Word Crimes by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic highlights the issues with grammar policing through humor, though it also sparks debate about literacy privilege and social inequality. Grammar nazis have even been found to be helpful to English learners.One aspect of grammar nazis that is often criticized is their insistence on grammatical \"purism.\" Grammar nazis strictly adhere to traditional grammar rules. However, their focus on minute details detracts from effective communication. These pedants fail to recognize the many dialects of English, such as African American English, as correct. This can exhibit racism or classism. They fail to acknowledge the difference between standard and linguistic grammar. Grammar nazis strictly adhere to etymological fallacy, and fail to recognize that words can have separate informal meanings.Many grammar pedants will rely on incorrect or outdated grammatical rules. Languages change over time, and formal grammar is not the only correct manner of speaking and writing. Conversational grammar is incredibly different. For example, a grammar nazi would be against using split infinitives, even though they are grammatically correct, and perfectly acceptable conversationally.Calling a grammar nazi a \"nazi\" is giving the word nazi a more lighthearted meaning in that context. Many argue that this is not an ethical practice, regarding the atrocities committed by the Nazis during WW2. Additionally, correcting people's grammar compulsively is oftentimes rude. These pedants can also be racist by not recognizing ethnic dialects.",

        "doc": "A person (pl.: people or persons, depending on context) is a being who has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts.\nIn addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.\nThe plural form \"people\" is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in \"a people\"), and this was the original meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person. The plural form \"persons\" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.\nThe criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law, and is closely tied to legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.\nPersonhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of slavery and the fight for women's rights, in debates about abortion, fetal rights, and in animal rights advocacy.\nVarious debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, postnatal humans are defined as persons. Likewise, certain legal entities such as corporations, sovereign states and other polities, or estates in probate are legally defined as persons.  However, some people believe that other groups should be included; depending on the theory, the category of \"person\" may be taken to include or not pre-natal humans or such non-human entities as animals, artificial intelligences, or extraterrestrial life.\nPersonal identity is the unique identity of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the same person, persisting through time. In the modern philosophy of mind, this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the diachronic problem of personal identity. The synchronic problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.Identity is an issue for both continental philosophy and analytic philosophy. A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.\nProposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory, the bundle theory of self, continuity of personality after the death of the physical body, and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves who persist over time at all.\nIn ancient Rome, the word persona (Latin) or prosopon (πρόσωπον; Ancient Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various \"personae\" in the stage play.The concept of person was further developed during the Trinitarian and Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.  During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the logos (Ancient Greek: Λóγος, romanized: Lógos/Verbum) and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word \"prosopon\" (Ancient Greek: πρόσωπον, romanized: prósōpon) from the Greek theatre. Therefore, the logos (the Ancient Greek: Λóγος, romanized: Lógos/Verbum), which was identified with the Christ, was defined as a \"person\" of  God. This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings. Trinitarianism holds that God has three persons.\nSince then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence. According to Jörg Noller, at least six approaches can be distinguished:\n\"The ontological definition of the person as \"an individual substance of a rational nature\" (Boethius).\nThe self-consciousness-based definition of the person as a being that \"can conceive itself as itself\" (John Locke).\nThe moral-philosophical definition of the person as \"an end in itself\" (Immanuel Kant). In current analytical debate, the focus has shifted to the relationship between bodily organism and person.\nThe theory of animalism (Eric T. Olson) states that persons are essentially animals and that mental or psychological attributes play no role in their identity.\nConstitution theory (Lynne Baker), on the other hand, attempts to define the person as a natural and at the same time self-conscious being: the bodily organism constitutes the person without being identical to it. Rather, it forms with it a \"unity without identity\".\n[... Another idea] for conceiving the natural-rational unity of the person has emerged recently in the concept of the \"person life\" (Marya Schechtman).\"\nOther theories attribute personhood to those states that are viewed to possess intrinsic or universal value. Value theory attempts to capture those states that are universally considered valuable by their nature, allowing one to assign the concept of personhood upon those states. For example, Chris Kelly argues that the value that is intuitively bestowed upon humans, their possessions, animals, and aspects of the natural environment is due to a value monism known as \"richness.\" Richness, Kelly argues, is a product of the \"variety\" and the \"unity\" within an entity or agent. According to Kelly, human beings and animals are morally valued and entitled to the status of persons because they are complex organisms whose multitude of psychological and biological components are generally unified towards a singular purpose in any moment, existing and operating with relative harmony.\nPrimus defines people exclusively as their desires, whereby desires are states which are sought for arbitrary or nil purpose(s). Primus views that desires, by definition, are each sought as ends in and of themselves and are logically the most precious (valuable) states that one can conceive. Primus distinguishes states of desire (or 'want') from states which are sought instrumentally, as a means to an end (on the basis of perceived 'need'). Primus' approach can thus be contrasted to Kant's moral-philosophical definition of a person: whereas Kant's second formulation of the categorical imperative states that rational beings must never be treated merely as a means to an end and that they must also always be treated as an end, Primus offers that the aspects that humans (and some animals) desire, and only those aspects, are ends, by definition.\n",

        "title": "Xeer",
        "doc": "Xeer (pronounced [ħeːr]) is the traditional legal system used by Somalis in Somalia, Djibouti, Somali Region of Ethiopia, and the North Eastern Province in Kenya. It is one of the three systems from which formal Somali law draws its inspiration, the others being civil law and Islamic law. It is believed to pre-date Islam. However, Islam influenced it, with Xeer incorporating many Islamic legal principles. Under this system, the elders, known as the xeer begti, serve as mediator judges and help settle court cases, taking precedent and custom into account. Xeer is polycentric in that different groups within Somali society have different interpretations of xeer.\nSomali society is traditionally structured around a patriarchal clan based system, subdivided into sub-clans, then lineages, and finally mag groupings. These groups are bound together either by family ties or contract. Xeer justice usually revolves around the latter groups, as these are the smallest. In these groups, each member is responsible aiding in the payment for the crimes of another and must accordingly bear some fraction of any decided punishment if the accused cannot afford to do so themselves. Within this system, only the victim or immediate family of a victim can bring criminal proceedings to xeer mediation. If the victim is a man, his father, brothers, or uncles can bring complaints. If the victim is a woman, complaints can be brought forward by the men in her family or the men in her husband's family.In xeer, crimes are transgressions against property rights. Justice is directed in the form of material compensation to the victim. If the accused is found guilty, some material restitution must be paid. If restitution cannot be given, mag retribution is due, measured in terms of livestock (usually healthy female camels), to be paid to the victim or the victim's family. There is no concept of imprisonment under xeer. In some cases, elders may advise that neither side seeks restitution or retribution. The verdict is enforced by the victim's family or else by all able-bodied clansmen within the area wherein the verdict is to be executed.\nXeer judges are made up of the heads of extended families. These family heads are chosen for their knowledge of the law and wisdom, but otherwise, there is no formal training, and each judge is allowed to formulate their own doctrines and legal principles. Multiple judges are chosen to preside over each case by the involved parties, with this delegation being called an \"ergo\". The number of judges involved in a case is usually around ten, though it can be as few as two.\nIn each case, the goal is to reach consensus between the parties. Arbitration traditionally takes place under a large tree, and the mediators ask each party to submit to the judge's ruling. In modern times, meeting halls are often used instead of sitting under a tree. Each party has the right to appoint a representative to speak on its behalf while a recorder loudly repeats any important points that are made. If a fact is disputed, its veracity must be obtained by the testimony of three witnesses. If this cannot be done, an oath must be sworn. Should proceedings become heated, the presiding judge may order a recess, wherein both parties discuss issues relating to the case in small informal groups. Once the mediation has been decided, an appeal may be requested, although all parties must agree.\nDifferent groups within Somali society undertake oral agreements with each other to define xeer law. Despite this informal nature, there is a series of generally accepted principles, agreements, and ideas that constitute xeer, referred to collectively as \"xissi adkaaday\". These are:the payment of mag by the collective group (clan, sub-clan, lineage, or mag group) from which an offender originates as compensation for the crimes of murder, bodily assault, theft, rape, and defamation of character, given to the victim or victim's family;\nthe protection of vulnerable or respected members of society such as older adults, women, children, poets, guests and religious people\nobligations to the family such as the payment of a dowry to a bride\nthe rights of a widower to marry the dead wife's sister and the inheritance of a widow by the dead man's brother\nthe punishments for elopement\nand the division and use of natural resources like water and land.\n",

        "doc": "Repurposing is the process by which an object with one use value is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.\nRepurposing is as old as human civilization, with many contemporary scholars investigating how different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways. More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as Instructables and other Maker culture communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-libertarianism.Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the Earthship style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as boat fenders and steel drums or plastic drums as feeding troughs and/or composting bins. Incinerator and power plant exhaust stack fly-ash is used extensively as an additive to concrete, providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as rags.\nAppropriation (art) is the repurposing of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them. The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the history of the arts (audiovisual, literary, musical and performing arts). In the audiovisual arts, to appropriate means to properly adopt, borrow, recycle or sample aspects (or the entire form) of human-made audiovisual culture. Notable in this respect are the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp and sampling in Hip Hop music.Steelpan drums are created from oil drums\nFull-size vans from the Big Three which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some depreciation to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups.A USB dead drop can be mounted on a brick wall since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one gigabyte.Everdrive and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download ROM images of video game cartridges onto SD cards while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.\nOld Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial accelerometer of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., Quake-Catcher Network.\nDiscarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly Project Argus), Wi-Fi links, and microwave amateur radio radio beacons.\nRight-hand-drive Jeep brand vehicles, such as the Jeep Wrangler, which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada postal service mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.Reusable packaging can be reused for a wide variety of other purposes.Recycling can also involve repurposing of materials, such as products using recycled paper.\nDrug repositioning (also known as \"drug repurposing\" or \"therapeutic switching\") is the application of known drugs and compounds to treat new diseases. Examples include Pfizer's Viagra for erectile dysfunction and Celgene's thalidomide for cancer.Real estate, including land and buildings, is routinely adaptive reused for other purposes, both short-term and long-term, due to its high fixed cost. An example is conversion of old industrial mills.Scrap metal has countless applications for repurposing.Furniture has countless applications for repurposing.\nKitchen utensils have many unique repurposing opportunities.\nBeverage bottles: Water bottles may be repurposed for solar water disinfection. Wat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew is a Buddhist temple in Thailand made from one million discarded beer bottles.\nRemoved house parts, like doors, also have countless potential repurposing applications.\n",

        "title": "The_Triple_Package",
        "doc": "The Triple Package: How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America is a book published in 2014 by two professors at Yale Law School, Amy Chua and her husband, Jed Rubenfeld. Amy Chua is also the author of the 2011 international bestseller, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.\nAccording to the preface, the authors find that \"certain groups do much better in America than others—as measured by various socioeconomic indicators such as income, occupational status, job prestige, test scores, and so on— [which] is difficult to talk about. In large part this is because the topic feels racially charged.\" Nevertheless, the book attempts to debunk racial stereotypes by focusing on three \"cultural traits\" that attribute to success in the United States.\nFollowing Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother in 2011, Chua wrote this book with her husband Jed Rubenfeld after observing a more prevalent trend of students from specific ethnic groups achieving better academic results than other ethnic groups. For example, a striking demographic pattern that more Mormon students in Yale are emerging than a couple years ago. According to an interview conducted by Harry Kreisler from the Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley, the authors explained such phenomenon prompted them to \"look further into how those groups perform outside of school, and come to a conclusion that for some reasons, those groups have a tendency to experience most upward social mobility than others.\"Before its publication, The Triple Package drew attention for its highly controversial assertion that though with tough economy, shrinking opportunity, and rising economic inequality, certain communities are outperforming the national average, experiencing upward mobility and educational attainment at dramatically high rates, and that this success has to do with certain inherent characteristics belonging to these cultural groups. This led critics to note the book was \"sure to garner just as much (if not more) controversy as her first book did.\"\nThe central argument of the book is that various ethnic groups that are \"starkly outperforming\"  the rest in America possess three distinct traits. These virtues are the presence of a superiority complex, the simultaneous existence of a sense of insecurity, and a marked capacity for impulse control.By definition, superiority is \"a deeply internalized belief in your group's specialness, exceptionality, or superiority.\" The authors claim that this element is derived from various sources. First, from a religious perspective, Mormons are introduced to their people's magnificent history and civilization. Second, from a social viewpoint, Nigerian immigrants belonging to the prestige entrepreneurial Igbo people. Third, a mixture of both: for example, Jews as \"chosen people\", and \"a moral people, a people of law and intellect, a people of survivors.\"The authors define insecurity as a species of discontent : an anxious uncertainty about your worth or place in society, a feeling or worry that you or what you've done or what you have is in some fundamental way not good enough.\" Immigrants for example are prone to insecurity because of social and financial anxiety, resulting in the sense of being discriminated against; a perception of danger; feelings of inadequacy and angst of losing their established social standing and possession.The authors refer to impulse control as \"the ability to resist temptation, especially the temptation to give up in the face of hardship or quit instead of persevering at a difficult task.\" For instance, Mormon culture celebrates strict self-discipline with their temperance, two-year mission, and abstinence from sexual relations before marriage. Chua compares that with the Marshmallow Experiment, where a child can either enjoy a piece of marshmallow instantly or wait and have twice as much of the treat later. She concludes that delayed gratification is one of the most important elements in the Triple Package.The authors add that a superiority complex and insecurity are not mutually exclusive. The coexistence of both qualities \"lies at the heart of every Triple Package culture\", producing a need to be recognized and an \"I'll show them\" mentality because the superiority a person has is not acknowledged by the society. Namely, immigrants suffer status collapse though moving up the economic ladder. Thus, this circumstance results in anxiety but also \"a drive and jaw-dropping accomplishment.\"\nThe book categorizes the cultural groups regarding their religion, national origin, and ethnic group.  By cultural groups, they refer that as members of the group that tend to be united or pass on a certain sense of outlooks and cultural values to their next generations.During an interview with Harry Kreisler, the authors explained how they collected the data by going through months of Census data, all available economic data, and from personal experience; and at last narrowed down to the eight cultural groups listed as the successful groups in the United States: Chinese, Jewish, Indian, Iranian, Lebanese, Nigerians, Cuban exiles and Mormons.\nAs both authors belong to one of the above groups and coming from an immigrant family, namely Chua being Chinese and Rubenfeld being Jewish, Chua further claims that \"Chinese Americans are three generations behind the Jews\" as both Jewish Americans and Chinese Americans share many similar behaviors like being instructed to learn how to play a musical instrument when they were little and encouraged to become a doctor, teacher or a lawyer.\nThe book has received polarized reviews from critics and public. Since Chua has been seen as a provocative figure who sparked a tense debate about parenting with Battle Hymn, this book certainly attracted much attention with its racially charged arguments. Alicia W. Stewart, writing for CNN, claims that \"it's no surprise that her latest book about success and cultural groups was given a bit of side-eye, even before it published.\"Some critics admired the book for \"meticulously document[ing]\" how some groups are more high-achieving. but others described it as an exercise in \"pop sociology\". The Independent (UK) gave a mixed review, concluding that \"the book is not racist; it is well written and seductive. But its premise is flawed, arguments pernicious and methods disingenuous. And there is a whiff of aromatic complacency on every page.\"\nIn general, positive reviews praised the book for tackling a controversial and complicated socioeconomic and cultural question and for creating a unified theory of success in America, while negative reviews criticized it for ignoring intergenerational wealth transmission as well as selection effects due to the subset of people from different regions who are able to emigrate.\nPublishers Weekly reviewed the book, concluding: \"This comprehensive, lucid sociological study balances its findings with a probing look at the downsides of the triple package—the burden of carrying a family's expectations, and deep insecurities that come at a psychological price.\"The Guardian commended the book for \"draw[ing] on eye-opening studies of the influence of stereotypes and expectations on various ethnic and cultural groups ... The authors' willingness to pursue an intellectual inquiry that others wouldn't is bracing.\"\nThe Kirkus Reviews review of the book concluded: \"On a highly touchy subject, the authors tread carefully, backing their assertions with copious notes. Though coolly and cogently argued, this book is bound to be the spark for many potentially heated discussions.\"\nAllison Pearson reviewed the book favorably for The Telegraph, calling it \"Powerful, passionate and very entertaining.\"\nLogan Beirne, published an article titled \"What George Washington teaches us about success\" in Fox News Opinion, that this book is \"filled with surprising statistics and sociological research […] Triple Package contends that success is driven not by inborn biology, but is instead propelled by qualities that can be cultivated by all Americans. The book serves as an opportunity to discuss what has helped drive America's triumphs in the past : and how we might harness this knowledge for our future.\"\nJ. D. Vance, writing in the National Review Online, described the book as \"sometimes funny, sometimes academic, and always interesting study of the cultural traits that make some groups outperform others in America. . . . [The Triple Package] asks a very important question: why are some of us doing so much better (or worse) than others? . . . I'm not sure that Chua and Rubenfeld have all the right answers. But I do know that by focusing on people—and the cultures that support and affect them—they're asking the right questions. That's more than I can say for most of the social policy experts occupying the airwaves today.\"\nLucy Kellaway, writing for Financial Times, called it \"the best universal theory of success I've seen.\"\nJennifer Lee, a sociologist and a professor at the University of California, Irvine, whose work has been quoted in The Triple Package, criticized the book in the online publication Zócalo Public Square. In her article, she asserts that Chua and Rubenfeld overlooked institutional and structural factors and asks \"But what happens if you measure success not just by where people end up—the cars in their garages, the degrees on their walls—but by taking into account where they started?\"  Lee concludes that after controlling parental accomplishment and education levels, people of Mexican origin are more successful in the U.S. than people of Chinese origin.Colin Woodard wrote a critical review of the book for the Washington Post, saying that the thesis of the book was constructed on \"methodological quicksand\" that was revealed by the case of the people of Appalachia. Also, he shares the same concern most critics have with this book, questioning \"might the successes of the exiles have more to do with their relative class, education and social advantages than the Triple Package?\", concluding that while people are told an A-minus is a bad grade in Battle Hymn, \"one wonders what Chua and Rubenfeld will make of an F.\"\nMaureen Callahan wrote an article titled \"Tiger Mom: Some cultural groups are superior\" for New York Post, generated heated debate in the public with its incendiary topic, calling the book \"a series of shock-arguments wrapped in self-help tropes, and it's meant to do what racist arguments do: scare people.\" She claims that Chua repeated the same argument from her previous book, Battle Hymn, the rise and ultimate supremacy of China : and this time, \"so well timed to deep economic anxiety, to the collective fear that the American middle class is about to disappear, for good.\"\nAlicia Stewart who wrote for CNN sums up several controversial issues in the book: namely, the definition of success is not universal; the traits of success are not a pattern; Triple package cultures highlight relatively less successful cultural groups; over-generalizing and honing in on groups promote a 'new racism'; the notion of the American dream is undermined.\nKhanh Ho was highly critical of the book in an article for the Huffington Post, concluding: \nI do have this question: If you arrive in the United States as part of the 1 percent that drained off all the resources from a latter-day colony is it any surprise that you were able to leverage your fortune into a career at a top-notch university? If you inherited your status, wealth, privilege, connections and all it got you was a well-paying job does it at all reflect your innate superiority? Or is your so-called success simply the logical conclusion to the fact that you simply started off better?\nJohn Crace wrote a satirical review-cum-summary of the book for The Guardian,  citing one of the Triple Package Traits : Impulse control is to \"resist this book.\"\nThe book was also negatively reviewed in Boston Globe, saying that \"if the book [did not] structured to focus on an underdeveloped notion that feels intentionally provocative, it would have been a lot better.\"\nJaya Sundaresh, writing for The Aerogram, claims that the authors by singling out eight cultural groups that they claim are \"exceptional\", \"leading us to wonder what is so wrong with other groups in America,\" suggesting that \"this kind of analysis smacks of cultural essentialism.\"\nWriting in Slate Magazine, Daria Roithmayr asserted that the book's argument \"doesn't hold water\" for several reasons, including avoidance of \"the pesky issue of race\", not adequately acknowledging \"first-wave advantage\", and noting that the authors \"are forced now to slice and dice the argument\" in order to explain away exceptions.\nBefore the book's publication, New York Post published an article titled \"Tiger Mom: Some cultural groups are superior\" which sparked controversy, including people using social media to voice their concerns. For example, David Leonard, a historian, tweeted \"Dear Amy Chua & Jed Rubenfeld, the 1920s called and want their (racial) theories back.\" Matt O'Brien tweeted \"The Return of the Troll\"; and Ellen Wu tweeted \"cringe worthy and racist.\"Israeli newspaper Haaretz published an article based on an interview of the authors about the book. An audio interview of the authors was published by Slate Magazine. Amy Chua was also interviewed in The Irish Times, where she emphasized that the book is \"about the rise and fall of cultural groups.\" The article notes that in spite of the success of Asian-American students, they have the lowest reported self-esteem. Chua stresses that the thesis of the book is \"intended to be a nuanced idea, not some superficial celebration. It can be very painful to be driven.\"",

        "doc": "Pet culture refers to the culture revolving around the interaction of humans and pets.\nModern day society has integrated animals into their everyday lives. Today, American families have said that their non-working, indoor animals are close enough to call them family. Many owners post photos and videos of their pets on social media to entertain other animal lovers. The relationship between sharing and watching has shown an increase in interest for pet owning. This increase in pet owning has impacted cat and dog populations within the animal community. Within mid-1960’s century America, their population has grown an impeccable amount compared to the human population. An average of 63% of American households have one pet, while 45% have multiple. Increase in pets have impacted the increasing number of veterinarians.Before the 1900’s, ownership of a pet was restricted to certain social classes who had the income to care for it. With modern day technology and medicine, the average lifespan of pets has changed. Indoor cats, on average, will live up to 13:14 years. While indoor dogs, on average, will live up to 6:10 years. Pet-keeping can be cost heavy. Throughout the average life of a pet in the United States, the owner may spend on average between $8,000 to $13,000. Pets may be kept for either nothing more than companionship or to also serve as working animals.\nPets have also gained more popularity in places of employment. Office pets are animals that live in or visit the workplace. Usually office pets belong to the company but may also be the personal pet of the CEO or owner, office manager, or another employee. In addition to office pets, there are also Pet-friendly work environments, where employees can bring their pets from home to work with them.The practice of having office pets and/or pet-friendly work environments has been known to occur in big businesses, medium-sized businesses, and small businesses. Reasons as to why a business would have an office pet include boosting employee morale, reducing stress and improving health, drawing in and recruiting new employees, improving communication and collaboration between coworkers, attracting customers and clients, and improving public relations between the business and the community. Additionally, business leaders have cited multiple advantages to having pet-friendly work environments such as improving company culture, boosting productivity, reducing employee turnover, boosting employer brand, improving employee satisfaction, boosting the mental and physical health of workers and giving employees more flexibility.\nIn the United States, the estimate of households that have dogs as pet is about 69 million. Nowadays, owners that have dogs have considered them their best friend and a part of their family. Owners that have suffered from mental illness, loneliness, and distress have lightly eased with the help of their dogs. Human and dog relationships have now been more emotional than practical. In the past, humans owned dogs for work purpose. Small dogs were used to scare off pest, while larger dogs were used for protection and identify danger. Other important jobs that people have used dogs to perform include, among other things, hunting for game, search and rescue for missing persons, herding of livestock and serving as therapy dogs for people.In the United States, there is an estimate of 45.3 million households that own a cat. In the past, humans owned cats for work purposes. The most common job for cats is killing or scaring off vermin such as pigeons and rodents. Additionally, cats (particularly puppy cats) have also been used as protection animals for their owners. Another job cats have been known to perform for humans is serving as therapy cats for people. Between cats and dogs, cats have been known to be the opposite of how dogs act. Cats are seen to be more independent and tend to themselves. Many believe that cats are only with humans for their own benefits, such as eating. Nowadays, this idea has changed as cats are known to change their performance based on how their owners act towards them. The type of cat, character, and its history impacts their behavior.In the United States, there is an estimate of 5.3 million households that have rodents as pets. Additionally, rats have also been used for work purpose as well such as bomb detection, laying computer link cables or serving as therapy animals for people. In the past, rodents were considered vermin that spread disease and were a threat to crops, as a result the practice of keeping small mammals as pets, is a relatively recent development, arising only after large-scale industrialization.In the United States, there is an estimate of 6.0 million households that own birds. As with other domestic animals, birds have been used to perform roles and tasks such as delivering messages, pigeon racing or falconry. Usually, ownership of birds requires an enclosure (such as a birdcages) or a tether (such as a jess) to keep the birds from getting loose.In the United States, an estimate of 11.8 million households who own a pet, own a fish. Humans that rent homes that cannot own dogs and/or cats look towards the option of owning a fish. This could also be true to those who have a serious health issue or extreme asthma. Owning a fish has little evidence of allergies, and overall extremely little danger compared to owning dogs or cats. There are bacterial risks, such as infection, when it comes to fish water, but can be prevented with proper cleaning care. Those that do own a fish with an aquarium believe it has beneficial properties, such as relaxation and a distraction from everyday life.Pet owning in America may cause trouble to the public. Owners may have to face the consequences of pets that misbehave. It may result in pressure and distress to their owners and nearby neighbors. Each year in the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that an average of 4.5 million people are attacked by a dog. Within those attacks, around 900,000 of them are serious and need immediate attention. Many pets are also known to carry diseases. Dogs, one of the most common pets in America, are known to transmit rabies to humans primarily through biting. Cats are carriers of Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that enters the brain and may cause toxoplasmosis. Pets are also known to cause people allergies. They could also trigger an asthma attack, for those who are allergic.",

        "title": "Consensus_reality",
        "doc": "Consensus reality refers to the generally agreed-upon version of reality within a community or society, shaped by shared experiences and understandings. This understanding arises from the inherent differences in individual perspectives or subjectivities relating to knowledge or ontology, leading to uncertainties about what is real. While various viewpoints exist, people strive to establish a consensus, serving as a pragmatic guide for social norms. The term carries both positive and negative connotations, as it is viewed critically by anti-realist theorists but recognized for its practical benefits in fostering shared beliefs. Consensus reality differs from consensual reality, with the former representing mutual agreement about what is true. Artists and thinkers have challenged consensus reality, aiming to disrupt established norms and question the authenticity of the world's reality.\nChildren have sometimes been described or viewed as \"inexperience[d] with consensus reality,\" though are described as such with the expectation that their perspective will progressively form closer to the consensus reality of their society as they age.\nIn considering the nature of reality, two broad approaches exist: the realist approach, in which there is a single, objective, overall reality believed to exist irrespective of the perceptions of any given individual, and the idealistic approach, in which it is considered that an individual can verify nothing except their own experience of the world, and can never directly know the truth of the world independent of that.Berger and Luckmann argue that \"reality is socially constructed and that the sociology of knowledge must analyze the process in which this occurs\". Rather than being a purely philosophical topic, the question of reality includes, for them, the sociological study of consensus reality.\nConsider this example: consensus reality for people who follow a particular theocentric religion is different from consensus reality for those who follow another theocentric religion, or from those that eschew theocentric religions in favor of science alone, for explaining life and the universe.\nIn societies where theocentric religions are dominant, the religious understanding of existence would be the consensus reality. In a predominantly secular society, where the consensus reality is grounded in science alone, the religious worldview would be the non-consensus (or alternative) reality.\nIn this way, different individuals and communities have fundamentally different world views, with fundamentally different comprehensions of the world around them, and of the constructs within which they live. Thus, a society that is, for example, completely secular and one which believes every eventuality to be subject to metaphysical influence will have very different consensus realities, and many of their beliefs on broad issues such as science, slavery, and human sacrifice may differ in direct consequence of the differences in the perceived nature of the world they live in.\nCharles Tart in his book \"The Awakening\" proposed an alternative term - \"conditioned reality \" (conditioned or conditional reality), pointing out the inaccuracy of the term \"consensus reality\", since no one asks an individual for consent whether he wants to live in a \"generally accepted reality\", because he is accustomed to it through “ conditioning ” - the development of conditioned reflexes in the process of education and socialization.\nSome idealists (subjective idealists) hold the view that there isn't one particular way things are, but rather that each person's  personal reality is unique. Such idealists have the world view which says that we each create our own reality, and while most people may be in general agreement (consensus) about what reality is like, they might live in a different (or nonconsensus) reality.Materialists may not accept the idea of there being different possible realities for different people, rather than different beliefs about one reality. So for them only the first usage of the term reality would make sense. To them, someone believing otherwise, where the facts have been properly established, might be considered delusional.The connotation of the term \"consensus reality\" is usually disparaging: it is usually employed by idealist, surrealist and other anti-realist theorists opposing or hostile to this \"reality,\" with the implication that this consensus reality is, to a greater or lesser extent, created by those who experience it. (The phrase \"consensus reality\" may be used more loosely to refer to any generally accepted set of beliefs.) However, there are those who use the term approvingly for the practical benefits of all agreeing on a common set of assumptions or experiences.Consensus reality is related to, but distinct from, consensual reality. The difference between these terms is that whereas consensus reality describes a state of mutual agreement about what is true (consensus is a noun), consensual reality describes a type of agreement about what is true (consensual is an adjective). In other words, reality may also be non-consensual, as when one person's preferred version of reality conflicts with another person's preferred version of reality. Consensual reality is relevant to understanding a variety of social phenomena, such as deception.Artists, writers, and theorists have attempted to oppose or undermine consensus reality while others have declared that they are \"ignoring\" it. For example, Salvador Dalí intended by his paranoiac-critical method to \"systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality\".",

        "title": "Civilization_state",
        "doc": "A civilization state, or civilizational state, is a country that aims to represent not just a historical territory, ethnolinguistic group, or body of governance, but a unique civilization in its own right. It is distinguished from the concept of a nation state by describing a country's dominant sociopolitical modes as constituting a category larger than a single nation. When classifying states as civilization states, emphasis is often placed on a country's historical continuity and cultural unity across a large geographic region.\nThe term was first coined in the 1990s as a way to describe China and later India, but has also been used to describe countries such as Egypt, Russia, Turkey, Iran and the United States.\nThe term has been popularized by Bruno Maçães in a series of essays since 2018.\nThe term \"civilization-state\" was first used by American political scientist Lucian Pye in 1990 to categorize China as having a distinct sociopolitical character, as opposed to viewing it as a nation state in the European model. The use of this new term implies that China was and still is an \"empire state\" with a unique political tradition and governmental structure, and its proponents asserted that the nation state model fails to properly describe the evolution of the Chinese state. Proponents of the label describe China as having a unique historical and cultural unity, derived from a continuous process of cultural syncretism. The term was further popularized by its use in When China Rules the World by British political scientist Martin Jacques.According to Li Xing and Timothy M. Shaw, the central feature of analyzing China as a civilization state is the view that the Chinese state derives its legitimacy from the continuation of a sociopolitical order which posits that the state maintains natural authority over its subjects, and that it is the \"guardian\" of both its citizens and their society, a view of the state that is completely distinct from the Westphalian nation-state model. Other scholars make the case that the key features of a civilization-state are the maintenance of an ethos of cultural unity despite displaying significant cultural diversity, across centuries of history and a large geographic space. Some specifically draw attention to the longevity of the Chinese writing system, or describe China's existence as being uniquely and inexorably tied to the past.\nGuang Xia pushes back on the idea of the uniqueness of a Chinese civilization-state. Xia argues that civilization-state discourse in China studies is an important and positive development, as it allows for characteristics of the modern Chinese state to be properly analyzed in the context of their history. However, Xia concludes that ultimately, all civilizations must reinvent themselves in the context of their history, and that it is a mistake to view China as a static entity or to portray it as being more tied to its past than the rest of the world.\nIndia is another example of a civilization state, with political commentators arguing that a shared Indian identity predates British colonization and Islamic invasions. India as a Hindu majority state, is perhaps the only nation that still follows a Bronze Age religion, i.e. Hinduism. It is suggested by some scholars, taking support of archaeological evidences together with analogy of later cult divinities and religious practices, that roots of Hinduism could be diagnosed in the Bronze Age civilization.By creating a civilizational continuation between ancient Egypt and contemporary Egypt with its Muslim characteristics, Egypt is another example of a civilization state that centers its continuous historical and cultural identity and tradition that contrast the West's global cultural dominance.Vladimir Putin's administration has at times embraced the rhetoric of portraying Russia as a distinct Eurasian civilization-state.British journalist Gideon Rachman argued in a 2019 article that the concept of a civilization state is at odds with modern conceptions of universal human rights and common democratic standards, and is inherently exclusive to minority groups who do not share the feature(s) that define a particular civilization state (for example, they may have a different religion).",

        "doc": "\"Born Sexy Yesterday\" is a trope that describes a character, typically a woman, who is physically attractive yet portrayed as childlike or naive, often with a level of intelligence or maturity that contradicts her appearance or behavior. These characters typically lack real-world experience, creating a dynamic where their sexual appeal contrasts with their innocence and unfamiliarity with social norms. This trope is prevalent in science fiction and gained critical attention after a 2017 video essay by YouTuber Jonathan McIntosh, known as Pop Culture Detective.\nThe Born Sexy Yesterday trope has persisted for decades but has recently gained critical attention, particularly following a 2017 video by YouTuber Jonathan McIntosh, known as Pop Culture Detective. Coined from the 1950 film Born Yesterday, where two men educate a naive showgirl, the term describes a common narrative device in science fiction, among other genres. Female characters are typically stunning yet childlike, embodying a paradox of adult sexuality paired with social naivety, and are often even artificially created. They often awaken in new and confusing worlds, relying on male counterparts for guidance. A prime example is Leeloo from The Fifth Element, who behaves and speaks like a baby, crafted to be \"perfect,\" naive, and whimsical while being sexualized without her awareness. Other examples include characters from Tron: Legacy, Splash, and Enchanted, who cater to a male fantasy of innocence and sexual purity, positioning their male guides as \"the most extraordinary man\" in their lives. These characters may take forms such as robots, mermaids, or otherworldly beings, consistently displaying childlike innocence despite their mature appearances. While these characters often serve as heroines, their portrayal perpetuates harmful stereotypes about female innocence and male dominance. McIntosh's video highlights the prevalence of the trope in various films, exposing its underlying sexism and paedophilic implications.The Born Sexy Yesterday trope features female characters who blend childlike innocence with adult physicality, often serving as love interests for male protagonists. A central element of this trope is the female character's ignorance, which allows the male protagonist to adopt a teacher-like role, guiding her in social norms and romantic interactions. He instructs her on socially acceptable behavior and guides her in romance and sex, despite lacking any qualifications beyond being the first person she becomes close to, leading her to idolize and fall in love with him. This dynamic, frequently described as \"mansplaining,\" stems from deep-seated male insecurities about sex and relationships. As McIntosh notes:\"The crux of the trope is a fixation on male superiority. A fixation with holding power over an innocent girl. To make this dynamic socially acceptable, science fiction often places a girl's mind in a sexualized adult woman's body. It’s a fantasy based on fear—fear of women who are men's equals in sexual experience and romantic history, and fear of losing the intellectual upper hand to women.\"The trope can take various forms, including pixies, mermaids, and dream girls, ultimately portraying a child trapped in an adult's body. Despite their innocence, these characters often excel in areas like combat or intellect, appealing to heterosexual male audiences. These women are naïve and unaware of the implications of nudity, sex, romance, or sexual interactions, and the male gaze in these films exploits this innocence. McIntosh highlights that the male lead is often a disenfranchised, “straight, red-blooded” man who struggles to connect with women of equal standing. Meanwhile, the female character, characterized by her naivety, falls for him simply because he exhibits basic human behavior, which she lacks. The women are depicted as untouched by other men’s attention, which allows the male characters to avoid comparison and the necessity for self-improvement. To legitimize this dynamic, the love interest is often represented as a grown woman.While the trope thrives in the science fiction, it is not confined to it, and although McIntosh examines this trope within the genre, he recognizes its roots in older, racist narratives where white male adventurers \"discover\" indigenous women. In science fiction, colonialism is replaced by traditional masculine ideologies, with the heterosexual male hero guiding the young woman and educating her about the world, including sex and romance. His infatuation is masked as a teaching role, justifying his actions.\nMcIntosh likens the Born Sexy Yesterday trope to the Manic Pixie Dream Girl archetype, noting that both involve disenfranchised men meeting naive women. However, he emphasizes that the Born Sexy Yesterday trope intensifies the dynamic by positioning women as submissive rather than equal partners.\nMcIntosh argues that the Born Sexy Yesterday trope reveals deep male insecurities regarding sex and relationships, reflecting a desire to control female identities and a fear of female agency. This trope embodies an obsession with power over innocent women, normalizing real-world sexism within the sci-fi and fantasy genres.\nThe Born Sexy Yesterday trope is prevalent in numerous female characters across various media, including Star Trek, Sheena, Planet of the Apes, Passengers, and Fifty Shades of Grey. While some narratives attempt to subvert its inherent sexism, the trope's presence remains evident prior to any potential subversion. Even in Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman, which was celebrated as a feminist film, Diana remains sexually inexperienced and unaware of her appeal, relying on Steve for guidance.Historically, the Born Sexy Yesterday trope is not new. The trope's roots can be traced to classic films such as Forbidden Planet and The Time Machine. It appears in Japanese anime, indigenous narratives, and classic Hollywood sci-fi films like The New World. In Forbidden Planet, for instance, the character Alta is deceived into kissing John under the guise of it being essential for her health, echoing manipulative grooming tactics. Other examples include Quorra from Tron Legacy, described as “profoundly naive [yet] unimaginably wise.”\nLeeloo from The Fifth Element is described as \"probably the most quintessential example\" of the Born Sexy Yesterday trope by Jonathan McIntosh. As the human vessel of a Supreme Being sent to combat the \"Great Evil,\" her body is celebrated by male characters, with one scientist expressing a desire to photograph her naked form after she is created. Leeloo, unaware of her own sex appeal, inadvertently undresses in public. She doesn’t speak English, instead communicating in childish gibberish and emotional outbursts. Korben responds to her naïveté—such as her inability to use a camera or dry herself—with condescension. While she is a powerful character capable of great destruction, her ignorance of the world often undermines her agency.\nMihaela Mihailova, an Assistant Professor in the School of Cinema at San Francisco State University, observes that Alita, the cyborg in Alita: Battle Angel, embodies the Born Sexy Yesterday trope in both her design and behavior. After being revived by Dr. Dyson Ido from a scrapyard, Alita's wide-eyed, innocent look emphasizes her naïveté as she navigates her new life with the guidance of her father figure and love interest.\nTelevision shows like Game of Thrones (with Daenerys and Viserys) and Stranger Things (featuring Mike and Eleven) exemplify the trope. The stereotype of the socially awkward \"nerd\" is also prevalent in The Big Bang Theory, where characters like Penny and the female guest stars exhibit Born Sexy Yesterday traits while Leonard and Howard embody the dominant creator role.\nThe Born Sexy Yesterday trope can also manifest in reverse, although male representations within the trope's framework are scarce, given its connections to insecurities surrounding masculinity. Typically, these male characters are depicted as naïve and socially awkward, making them less attractive as sexual interests. Unlike their female counterparts, they are not objectified; their ineptitude is framed humorously rather than pitiably. In films like Big and Blast from the Past, male characters display similar traits but often become the punchlines. This discrepancy may arise from the general lack of appeal for women regarding inexperienced adolescent boys. While films such as Edward Scissorhands and The Shape of Water feature male characters with naïveté, they lack the sexualized portrayal characteristic of female Born Sexy Yesterday figures. For instance, in Edward Scissorhands, Edward engages in genuine love without deception, with relationships developing in spite of his inexperience.Hot Frosty, a film about a snowman coming to life, is an example of a movie in which the Born Sexy Yesterday trope is applied to a male character without losing its highly sexualized aspects.\nAccording to writer Elvia Wilk, the Born Sexy Yesterday trope can be contrasted with Lynn Hershman Leeson's works, which explore themes of identity and agency in innovative ways. Her characters often embody a more complex understanding of femininity, as seen in Teknolust, where the protagonist, Ruby, not only seduces men but also teaches them, signifying sexual liberation rather than dependence.",

        "title": "Artificial_plants",
        "doc": "Artificial plants are imitations of natural plants used for commercial or residential decoration. They are sometimes made for scientific purposes (the collection of glass flowers at Harvard University, for example, illustrates the flora of the United States). Artificial plants vary widely from mass-produced varieties that are distinguishable from real plants by casual observation to highly detailed botanical or artistic specimens.\nMaterials used in their manufacture have included painted linen and shavings of stained horn in ancient Egypt, gold and silver in ancient Rome, rice-paper in China, silkworm cocoons in Italy, colored feathers in South America, and wax and tinted shells. Modern techniques involve carved or formed soap, nylon netting stretched over wire frames, ground clay, and mass-produced injection plastic mouldings. Polyester has been the main material for manufacturing artificial flowers since the 1970s. Most artificial flowers in the market nowadays are made of polyester fabric and plastic.\nThe industry is now highly specialized with several different manufacturing processes. Hundreds of artificial flower factories in the Pearl River delta area of Guangdong province in China have been built since the early 1980s. Thousands of 40-foot containers of polyester flowers and plants are exported to many countries every year.Five main processes may be distinguished:The first step consists of putting the polyester fabric in gelatine in order to stiffen it.\nThe second consists of cutting up the various polyester fabrics and materials employed into shapes suitable for forming the leaves, petals, etc.; this may be done with scissors, but is more often done with stamps that can cut through a dozen or more thicknesses at one blow.\nNext, the veins of the leaves are impressed by means of silk screen printing with a dye, and the petals are given their natural rounded forms by goffering irons of various shapes.\nThe next step is to assemble the petals and other parts of the flower, which is built up from the center outwards.\nThe fifth is to mount the flower on a stalk of brass or iron wire wrapped with suitably colored material, and to add the leaves to complete the spray.\nWhile the material most often used to make artificial flowers is polyester fabric, both paper and cloth flowers are also made with origami.\nThe art of nylon flower making is an easy to learn craft which uses simple tools and inexpensive material to achieve stunning results. Nylon flower making enjoyed a brief popularity in the United States in the 1970s and soon became very popular in Japan. In recent years, the craft's popularity has spread Asia, Europe and Australia. With the advent of new colors and materials, the art has expanded to infinite new possibilities of nylon flower making.The basic materials needed to make nylon flowers include: wire, stem wire, nylon stocking, nylon threading, floral tape and stamen. Some flowers require cotton balls or sheets (or batting), white glue, acrylic paint and paint brushes.\nSilk flowers are crafted from a protein fibre spun by the silk worm, producing lifelike flowers. Flowers described as being made of silk with a \"real touch technique\" are not made of silk, but rather are made of polyester, polymers and plastics. Moreover, textile items made of polyester but marketed as \"silk\" violate the US federal law : specifically the 1959 Textile Fiber Products Identification Act.There are two methods:Carved: A bar with layered coloured soap is mounted in a lathe, and circular grooves are chiseled into it. The finished flower is symmetric and regular, but the flowers are not identical and can be called handmade.\nMoulded: An oil-less soap milled to a powder is mixed with water, and the paste is used as a modelling material. Leaf and petal textures are stamped or rolled onto the soap. This is an expensive, labour-intensive process.\nClay flowers are made by hand from special air-dry polymer clay or cold porcelain, steel wire, paint, glue, tape and sometimes paper and foam as a filler.With the help of cutters, where each flower has its own cutter set, the parts are cut from the still soft clay and then formed with specially designed tools. After drying, these parts are, when needed, painted with precision and then very precisely assembled into a whole flower. When made by a skilful artisan, clay flowers can be very realistic. From Thailand, where this art is very popular, it has spread to Europe, Russia and the US.\nGlass is melted and blown by hand into flower shapes. Working with glass at high temperatures to form a flower is very difficult, which is why glass flowers are much more expensive than typical artificial flowers.Injection moulding is used for mass manufacture of plastic flowers. Plastic is injected into a preformed metal die.The journal Ethnobotany Research and Applications published a tongue-in-cheek paper that claims to be the culmination of a six-year project in the exhaustive taxonomy of artificial plants, and lumped the group into a single family called the Simulacraceae (\"the family of simulated plants\").Floral wreaths made by the ancient Egyptians were formed from thin plates of horn stained in different colors. They also sometimes consisted of leaves of copper, gilt or were silvered over. The ancient Romans excelled in the art of imitating flowers in wax and in this branch of the art attained a degree of perfection which has not been approached in modern times. Crassus, renowned for his wealth, gave to the victors in the games he celebrated at Rome crowns of artificial leaves made of gold and silver.In more recent times, Italians were the first to acquire celebrity for the skill and taste they displayed in this manufacture. Later English, American, and especially French manufactures were celebrated. The Chinese and Japanese show great dexterity in this work. These early artificial flowers were made  out of many-coloured ribbons which were twisted together and attached to small pieces of wire. But these first attempts were decidedly crude.\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the Swedish artist Emma Fürstenhoff became internationally renowned in Europe for her artificial flower arrangements of wax in a technique regarded as a novelty in contemporary Europe. Wax flower sculptures were popular in the 1840s and 1850s in Britain, with noted sculptors including the London-based Emma Peachey and the Mintorn family.\nIn the 1910s, Beat-Sofi Granqvist studied the manufacture of artificial flowers in Germany. After returning to Finland, she founded Finland's first artificial flower factory, next to her apartment at Pieni Roobertinkatu 4-6.\nIn the course of time feathers were substituted for ribbons, a more delicate material, but one to which it was not so easy to give the requisite shades of color. The plumage of the birds of South America was adapted for artificial flowers on account of the brilliancy and permanence of the tints, and the natives of that continent long practised with success the making of feather flowers. The London Zoo contains a collection of artificial flowers made out of the feathers of hummingbirds.\n",

        "doc": "Clothing physiology is a branch of science that studies the interaction between clothing and the human body, with a particular focus on how clothing affects the physiological and psychological responses of individuals to different environmental conditions.  The goal of clothing physiology research is to develop a better understanding of how clothing can be designed to optimize comfort, performance, and protection for individuals in various settings, including outdoor recreation, occupational environments, and medical contexts.\nHuman clothing motives are frequently oversimplified in cultural and sociological theories, with the assumption that they are solely motivated by modesty, adornment, protection, or sex. However, clothing is primarily motivated by the environment, with its form being influenced by human characteristics and traits, as well as physical and social factors such as sex relations, costume, caste, class, and religion. Ultimately, clothing must be comfortable in various environmental conditions to support physiological behavior. The concept of clothing has been aptly characterized as a quasi-physiological system that interacts with the human body.Clothing can be considered as a quasi-physiological system that interacts with the body in different ways, just like the distinct physiological systems of the human body, such as digestive system and nervous system, which can be analyzed systematically.The acceptance and perceived comfort of a garment cannot be attributed solely to its thermal properties. Rather, the sensation of comfort when wearing a garment is associated with various factors, including the fit of the garment, its moisture buffering properties, and the mechanical characteristics of the fibers and fabrics used in its construction.The field of clothing physiology concerns the complex interplay between the human body, environmental conditions, and clothing. Through the use of scientific methods, it is possible to accurately measure and quantify the effects of clothing on wearer comfort and overall well-being.\nLouis Newburgh is widely recognized among thermal physiologists primarily due to his role as the editor of \"Physiology of Heat Regulation and the Science of Clothing\". \nFrom a physiological perspective, the purpose of clothing is to shield the body from extreme temperatures, whether they be hot or cold. The role of clothing in affecting the wearer's comfort can be described as the connection between the body and the surroundings. When engaged in outdoor activities, the individual's comfort level is influenced by various environmental factors, such as air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, atmospheric and ground thermal radiation. The wearer's posture, metabolic rate, sweating rate, and bodily processes such as moisture absorption, sweat evaporation, and heat loss through conduction and convection via blood, are among additional factors that also play a role in determining the individual's comfort level.\nThe contact between clothing and skin facilitates the regulation of body temperature through the control of blood flow and sweat evaporation in localized areas. However, the design of functional fabrics that efficiently regulate skin temperature must take into account crucial factors such as age, gender, and activity level.The skin plays a vital role in safeguarding the body's homeostasis by performing a variety of crucial protective functions. Clothing and other textiles interact dynamically with the skin's functions, and the mechanical properties of the fabric, such as its surface roughness, can lead to non-specific skin reactions, such as wool intolerance or keratosis follicularis.\nIt's common to express metabolic activity in terms of heat production. A resting adult typically generates 100 W of heat, with a significant amount dissipating through the skin. Heat production per unit area of skin, referred to as 1 met, is around 58 W/m2 for a resting individual, based on the average male European's skin surface area of approximately 1.8 m2. The average female European's skin surface area is 1.6 m2 for comparison.Skin temperatures that correspond to comfort during stationary activities range from 91.4°F to 93.2°F (33°C to 34°C), and these temperatures decrease as the level of physical activity increases. Skin temperature that exceeds 45°C or falls below 18°C induces a sensation of pain. Internal temperatures increase with activity. The brain's temperature regulatory center is around 36.8°C when at rest and rises to about 37.4°C when walking and 37.9°C when jogging. A temperature below 28°C can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia, while a temperature above 43°C can result in permanent brain damage. Thus, it's crucial to regulate body temperature carefully for both comfort and health.\nClothing insulation can be denoted using the unit of measurement called clo. In the absence of clothing, a thin layer of static air known as the boundary layer forms in close proximity to the skin, acting as an insulating layer that restricts heat exchange between the skin and the surrounding environment. This layer typically offers approximately 0.8 clo units of insulation in a motionless state. It's difficult to apply this generalization to very thin fabric layers or underwear, as they occupy an existing static air layer of no more than 0.5 cm thickness. Consequently, these thin layers offer minimal contribution to the clothing's intrinsic insulation.\nThe standard measure for clothing insulation is 1.57 clo·cm-1 in thickness, which is equivalent to 4 clo·inch-1.\nThe advancements in fibers, textiles, electronics, functional finishing, and clothing physiology are anticipated to improve human life in numerous areas such as medicine, military, firefighting, extreme sports, and other apparel applications. The study of clothing physiology has been prompted by the need to design effective clothing systems for various specialized environments such as space, polar regions, underwater operations, and industrial settings.Comfort is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various perceptions, including physiological, social, and psychological needs. After sustenance, clothing is one of the most vital objects that can satisfy comfort requirements. This is because clothing offers a range of benefits, including aesthetic, tactile, thermal, moisture, and pressure comfort.The clothing physiology comfort of an athlete is significantly influenced by the compression effect exerted by their garments. The degree of compression load exerted by the clothing has a direct correlation with the intensity of sweating and the resulting elevation in skin temperature. Specifically, a greater compression load on the body results in a higher degree of sweating and increased skin temperature.Thermophysiological models have become a prevalent tool for forecasting human physiological reactions in varying environmental and clothing conditions.Clothing physiology can be assessed through the utilization of various advanced instruments, including: Sherlock is a thermal manikin test device developed by the Hohenstein Institutes to evaluate clothing physiology, and it is equipped with perspiration simulation capabilities.\nIn the SpaceTex experiment, novel fabrics were evaluated for their ability to enhance heat transfer and manage sweat during physical activity, based on their antibacterial properties. Quick-drying T-shirts made from such fabrics would be advantageous to athletes, firefighters, miners, and military personnel. This marks the first experiment in clothing physiology conducted in microgravity, with sportswear manufacturers aiming to improve their products accordingly. In fact, a modified polyester has already been developed for use by the Swiss military.The integumentary system is a significant immune organ, possessing both specific and non-specific activities related to immunity. Antimicrobial fabrics could potentially disrupt the skin's non-specific defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial peptides or the resident microflora.The social psychology of dress entails comprehending the interconnections that exist between attire and human conduct.",

        "title": "John_Hopkins_(political_activist)",
        "doc": "John Victor Lindsay \"Hoppy\" Hopkins (15 August 1937 : 30 January 2015) was a British photographer, journalist, researcher and political activist, and \"one of the best-known underground figures of 'Swinging London' \" in the late 1960s.\nHopkins was born on 15 August 1937 in Slough, Buckinghamshire, England.After attending Felsted School in Essex, Hopkins went on to graduate in 1958 with a degree in physics and mathematics from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, which he had entered on a scholarship in 1955, and he began to work as a laboratory technician at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire. When he took a trip to Moscow to attend a Communist youth festival, his security clearance was revoked. Hopkins then re-located to London at the beginning of 1960, and began to work as a photographer for newspapers and music magazines including Jazz News, The Guardian, Melody Maker and Peace News. He photographed many of the leading musicians of the period, including The Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Hopkins also recorded the seedier side of London, with photographs of tattoo parlours, cafés, prostitutes and fetishists.\nBy the mid-1960s, he was at the centre of London's emerging underground scene and recorded many peace marches, poetry readings and \"happenings\", as well as photographing leading counter-cultural figures, including Allen Ginsberg and Malcolm X. Hopkins compiled and stencil-duplicated the names, contact details and interests of all of London's \"movers and shakers\". He then gave all of them a copy. This action is credited with greatly boosting the 1960s London-based underground movement.\nIn 1966, with Rhaune Laslett and others, he helped set up the London Free School in Notting Hill. This in turn led to the establishment of the Notting Hill carnival, first organised by Laslett with the guidance of local activists including Michael X. As an extension of the Free School news-sheet The Gate, in 1966 Hopkins and Barry Miles co-founded the influential magazine International Times (IT). Hopkins also set up the UFO Club with Joe Boyd, with Pink Floyd as the resident band.\nArrested for cannabis possession, Hopkins elected for trial by jury. In court on 1 June 1967, he claimed that cannabis was harmless and that the law should be changed. The judge, describing Hopkins as \"a pest to society\", sentenced him to nine months in prison for keeping premises for the smoking of cannabis and possession of cannabis, although Hopkins served only six months. He was jailed at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs. A \"Free Hoppy\" movement sprang up and, as one particular consequence, Stephen Abrams began co-ordinating a campaign for the liberalisation of the law on cannabis. This led to the publication in The Times on 24 July of a full-page advertisement that described the existing law as \"immoral in principle and unworkable in practice\", signed by Francis Crick, George Melly, Jonathan Miller and the Beatles. Paul McCartney, initially clandestinely, arranged the funding for this advertisement as a tribute to Hoppy, at the instigation of Barry Miles.\nHopkins remained a member of IT′s editorial board and a major contributor, and founded BIT as an information and agitprop arm. Hopkins favoured the more anarchistic elements in the \"underground\" centred on Ladbroke Grove, such as former UFO doorman Mick Farren, who by 1967 was also working at the IT newspaper.\nIn the 1970s, Hopkins was involved in researching the social uses of video for UNESCO, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Home Office and others, and edited the Journal of the Centre for Advanced TV Studies. Later, he worked as a technical journalist in the video trade press, and co-authored distance learning video training courses. Subsequently, he took and exhibited macro photography of flowers and other plants, and co-authored papers on plant biochemistry at the University of Westminster. He also exhibited his photographs of events and personalities in the 1960s. \nHopkins died at the age of 77 on 30 January 2015.\n",

The full signatories as of January 2024 are Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Peru, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nThe Washington Accord recognizes that there is substantial equivalence of programs accredited by those signatories. Graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries are recognized by the other signatory countries as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering. Recognition of accredited programs is not retroactive but takes effect only from the date of admission of the country to signatory status.The Washington Accord covers both undergraduate and postgraduate engineering degrees. Engineering technology programs are not covered by the accord. Engineering technology programs are covered under the Sydney Accord and Dublin Accord. Only qualifications awarded after the signatory country or region became part of the Washington Accord are recognized. The accord is not directly responsible for the licensing of professional engineers and the registration of chartered engineers but it does cover the academic requirements that are part of the licensing processes in signatory countries.The following are the signatory countries and territories of the Washington Accord, their respective accreditation bodies and years of admission:",

        "doc": "Social construction of technology (SCOT) is a theory within the field of science and technology studies. Advocates of SCOT—that is, social constructivists—argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to technological determinism and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.\nSCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the sociology of scientific knowledge, and its subtopics include actor-network theory  (a branch of the sociology of science and technology) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian Thomas P. Hughes. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see strong program). Leading adherents of SCOT include Wiebe Bijker and Trevor Pinch.\nSCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is \"the best\"—researchers must look at how the criteria of being \"the best\" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded.  Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.\nSCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.\nAt the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the strong programme in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the Principle of Symmetry as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.The Principle of Symmetry holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same kind of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (a posteriori attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology.  All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.The symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their \"objective truth\", or inherent \"technical superiority\", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its \"advanced technology\" compared to the \"primitiveness\" of the Penny Farthing, but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing : in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven Safety Bicycle. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.\nA weak reading of the Principle of Symmetry points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.\nA strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.\nThe Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR) introduced the SCOT theory in two stage.The first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.Interpretative flexibility means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly aesthetics to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.\nThese alternative interpretations generate different problems to be solved. For the bicycle, it means how features such as aesthetics, convenience, and speed should be prioritized. It also considers tradeoffs, such as between traction and speed.\nThe most basic relevant groups are the users and the producers of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated : users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. Trevor Pinch has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology.  The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.Just as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.The different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the \"Anti-cyclists\" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.The second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.Over time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:\nRhetorical closure: When social groups see the problem as being solved, the need for alternative designs diminishes. This is often the result of advertising.\nRedefinition of the problem: A design standing in the focus of conflicts can be stabilized by using it to solve a different, new problem, which ends up being solved by this very design. As an example, the aesthetic and technical problems of the air tire diminished, as the technology advanced to the stage where air tire bikes started to win the bike races. Tires were still considered cumbersome and ugly, but they provided a solution to the \"speed problem\", and this overrode previous concerns.\nClosure is not permanent.  New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the \"green\" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)\nMany other historians and sociologists of technology extended the original SCOT theory.This is often considered the third stage of the original theory.For example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book \"The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America\" the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.\nIn 1993, Langdon Winner published a critique of SCOT entitled \"Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology.\"  In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the consequences of the technologies after the fact. This results in a sociology that says nothing about how such technologies matter in the broader context.\nIt examines social groups and interests that contribute to the construction of technology, but ignores those who have no voice in the process, yet are affected by it. Likewise, when documenting technological contingencies and choices, it fails to account for those options that never made it to the table. According to Winner, this results in conservative and elitist sociology.\nIt is superficial in that it focuses on how the immediate needs, interests, problems and solutions of chosen social groups influence technological choice, but disregards any possible deeper cultural, intellectual or economic origins of social choices concerning technology.\nIt actively avoids taking any kind of moral stance or passing judgment on the relative merits of the alternative interpretations of a technology. This indifference makes it unhelpful in addressing important debates about the place of technology in human affairs.\nOther critics include Stewart Russell with his letter in the journal Social Studies of Science titled \"The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker\".\nDeborah Deliyannis, Hendrik Dey, and Paolo Squatriti criticize the concept of social construction of technology for being a false dichotomy with a technologically determinist straw man that ignores third, fourth and more alternatives, as well as for overlooking the process of how the technology is developed as something that can work. For example, accounting for which groups would have interests in a windmill cannot explain how a windmill is practically constructed, nor does it account for the difference between having the knowledge but for some reason not using it and lacking the knowledge altogether. This distinction between knowledge that have not yet been invented and knowledge that is merely prevented from being used by commercial, bureaucratic or other socially constructed factors, which it is argued that SCOT overlooks, is argued to explain the archaeological evidence of rich technological cultures in the aftermath of the collapse of civilizations (such as early medieval technology in the aftermath of the collapse of the Roman Empire, which was much richer than it is depicted as by the \"Dark Medieval\" stereotype) as a result of technology being remembered even when prevented from being used with the potential to being put into use when the artificial repression is no longer in place due to societal collapse.\n",

        "doc": "The concept of engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the pulley, lever, and wheel. Each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering, exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful tools and objects.\nThe term engineering itself has a much more recent etymology, deriving from the word engineer, which itself dates back to 1325,\nwhen an engine’er (literally, one who operates an engine) originally referred to \"a constructor of military engines.\" In this context, now obsolete, an \"engine\" referred to a military machine, i. e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). The word \"engine\" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), meaning \"innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.\"\nLater, as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline of military engineering (the original meaning of the word \"engineering,\" now largely obsolete, with notable exceptions that have survived to the present day such as military engineering corps, e. g., the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers).\nThe ziggurats of Mesopotamia, the pyramids and Pharos of Alexandria in ancient Egypt, cities of the  Indus Valley civilization, the Acropolis and Parthenon in ancient Greece, the aqueducts, Via Appia and Colosseum in the Roman Empire, Teotihuacán, the cities and pyramids of the Mayan, Inca and Aztec Empires, and the Great Wall of China, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of the ancient civil and military engineers.The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC, and then in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991-1802 BC). The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911-609) BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nThe earliest architect known by name is Imhotep. As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (a Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630-2611 BC. He may also have been responsible for the first known use of columns in architecture.\nKush developed the Sakia during the 4th century BC, which relied on animal power instead of human energy. Reservoirs in the form of Hafirs were developed in Kush to boost irrigation. Sappers were employed to build causeways during military campaigns. Kushite ancestors built speos between 3700 and 3250 BC. Bloomeries and blast furnaces were also created during the Meroitic period.\nThe earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.\nAncient Greece developed machines both in the civilian and military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, an early known model of a mechanical analog computer, and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes, are examples of Greek mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial revolution and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.\nChinese and Roman armies employed complex military machines including the Ballista and catapult. In the Middle Ages, the Trebuchet was developed. In 132, polymath Zhang Heng invented the seismoscope for detecting earthquakes, which was not invented anywhere else in the world until 1,100 years later.\nHuan Tan's Xinlun is the earliest text to describe the trip hammer device powered by hydraulics (i.e., a waterwheel), which was used to pound and decorticate grain.\nByzantines translated and preserved countless Greek manuscripts and also made contributions to engineering in the early medieval world. Anthemius of Tralles, and Isidore of Miletus, were responsible for the architecture of the Hagia Sophia church in 532-537 CE.The Greek fire, invented by Callinicus of Heliopolis was a weapon used by the Byzantines. It consisted of flammable substances such as petroleum, naphtha, quicklime, sulphur, resin and potassium nitrate.\nIslamic Golden Age witnessed advances of engineering knowledge, after translate the works of Greek, Persian, Roman, and Indian scholars.The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD. The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt.\nThe cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD, and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century, both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century.\nAfter translating the works of Hero of Alexandria, by Qusta ibn Luqa, the earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century. In 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns. \nAl-Jazari built five machines to pump water for the kings of the Turkish Artuqid dynasty and their palaces. Besides over 50 ingenious mechanical devices, Al-Jazari also developed and made innovations to segmental gears, mechanical controls, escapement mechanisms, clocks, robotics, and protocols for designing and manufacturing methods.\nThe first fully-functioning steam engine was built in 1716 by blacksmith Thomas Newcomen. The development of this device gave rise to the Industrial Revolution in the coming decades, allowing for the beginnings of mass production.With the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering.\nThe following images are samples from a deck of cards illustrating engineering instruments in England in 1702. They illustrate a range of engineering specializations, that would eventually become known as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, geodesy and geomatics, and so on.\nEach card includes a caption explaining the purpose of the instrument:\nThe inventions of Thomas Savery and the Scottish engineer James Watt gave rise to modern Mechanical Engineering. The development of specialized machines and their maintenance tools during the industrial revolution led to the rapid growth of Mechanical Engineering both in its birthplace Britain and abroad.The discipline of Electrical Engineering was shaped by the experiments of Alessandro Volta in the 19th century, the experiments of Michael Faraday, Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric motor in 1872. Electrical engineering became a profession late in the 19th century. Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network and the first electrical engineering institutions to support the new discipline were founded in the UK and US. Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, Francis Ronalds stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.\nThe work of  James Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of Electronics. The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of Electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other Engineering specialty.\nChemical Engineering, like its counterpart Mechanical Engineering, developed in the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants. The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.\nAeronautical Engineering deals with aircraft design while Aerospace Engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach envelope of the discipline by including spacecraft design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the turn of the 20th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering. Only a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers, the 1920s saw extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of World War I military aircraft. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments.\nThe first PhD in engineering (technically, applied science and engineering) awarded in the United States went to Willard Gibbs at Yale University in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.\nIn 1990, with the rise of computer technology, the first search engine was built by computer engineer Alan Emtage.\n",

        "doc": "Women have played a role in engineering in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years, despite the various societal barriers facing them. In the 18th and 19th century, there were few formal training opportunities for women to train as engineers and frequently women were introduced to engineering through family companies or their spouses. Some women did have more formal educations in the late 19th century and early 20th century, normally in mathematics or science subjects. There are several examples of women filing patents in the 19th century, including Sarah Guppy, Henrietta Vansittart and Hertha Ayrton.\nDuring the first two decades of the 20th century new opportunities arose for women to go to university and earn degrees and there were increasing numbers of women studying maths and physics at universities across the UK. The job opportunities for women opened up by World War I meant many women were trained in various forms of engineering. In 1919, the Women's Engineering Society (WES) was founded to protect these jobs for women, which, once the war ended, were handed back to the men returning from the front, as decreed by the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act (1919).\nThe 1920s and 30s produced many successful women engineers, who were able to forge careers for themselves in various fields, including aeronautical, automotive and electrical engineering. Many of these women were members of WES.\nInventors and engineers in the early 19th century in the UK include Sarah Guppy, the first woman in the UK to patent a bridge. Later in the 19th century, there are more examples of women patenting inventions and practising as engineers. Naval engineer Henrietta Vansittart, who was introduced to engineering by her father James Lowe, contributed to naval engineering and held patents across the world for the Lowe-Vansittart propeller. Similarly, another naval engineer, Blanche Thornycroft, found her way into engineering through a family connection. She worked as part of her father's engineering business on the Isle of Wight.Electrical engineer and physicist, Hertha Ayrton, was the first woman admitted to the IEE (the Institution of Electrical Engineers, now the IET), the premier British electrical engineering profession institution, in recognition of her work on electrical arc lighting.\nMany women in this era were collaborators in engineering projects with their husbands. The effort to electrify the home in the late 19th century involved many women, including Alice Mary Gordon, who wrote a book called Decorative Electricity, which included a section detailing life as an engineering spouse. Katharine Parsons worked with her husband Sir Charles Parsons on the steam turbine engine and later founded the Women's Engineering Society. Margaret, Lady Moir described herself as an \"engineer by marriage\" through her relationship with Ernest Moir. Several of the women who went on to be founding members of WES were also involved in the women's suffrage movement, including Katharine Parsons and her daughter, Rachel Parsons, Lady Moir, Laura Annie Willson (who was arrested twice for suffragette activities) and Caroline Haslett.\nThe 1911 census recorded no woman listing her profession as an engineer. However, at the start of the 20th century in the UK, there were greater opportunities for women to study at university and there were more instances of women studying for degrees in physics, mathematics, and engineering subjects. Nina Cameron Graham graduated from University of Liverpool in 1912 with a degree in Civil Engineering, the first British woman to qualify as an engineer. She married a fellow student and moved to Canada. Electrical Engineer and businesswoman Margaret Partridge studied maths at Bedford College, graduating in 1914. Aeronautical engineer Hilda Lyon went to study maths at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1915. Many women attended Loughborough College (now University), which admitted the first cohort of women engineers in 1919, including mechanical engineer Verena Holmes and engineer, writer and traveller Claudia Parsons. Georgina Kermode's career as socialite, suffragette, metallurgist and serial patentee (in particular the first successful postage stamp selling machines), seems to have emerged from her early marriage to an engineer, whom she soon left behind. Many women gained engineering experience during World War One. As men were away fighting, jobs in factories had to be filled by women. Women in engineering such as Dorothée Pullinger, Rachel Parsons, Margaret Dorothea Rowbotham and Laura Annie Willson all learned important aspects of their trades through working during World War One, particularly in the production of munitions. Recognition of the roles naval architects Blanche Thornycroft, Eily Keary, and Rachel Parsons played was recognised on 9 April 1919 when they became the first three women to be admitted as associate members by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, Keary having been the first woman to contribute a paper in the institution's transactions in 1916.\nOnce the war was over, these jobs were threatened by the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act (1919), which stated that the jobs women filled had to be handed back to the men returning from the front. Another act of parliament later in 1919 attempted to improve women's professional and educational rights. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 received Royal Assent on 23 December 1919. The act enabled women to join the professions and professional bodies (including those representing the engineering professions), to sit on juries and be awarded degrees:\n\"A person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function, or from being appointed to or holding any civil or judicial office or post, or from entering or assuming or carrying on any civil profession or vocation, or for admission to any incorporated society (whether incorporated by Royal Charter or otherwise)...\"\nIt was an enabling act, not an enforcing one, but did open the doors of the professional engineering institutions to women who could earn the qualifications and had the professional experience required to pass the entry examinations.\nThe Women's Engineering Society - the first of its kind in the world - was founded on 23 June 1919 to protect the jobs that women had gained during World War One and to continue promoting the place of women in engineering. Seven women signed the foundation documents: Eleanor Shelley-Rolls, Margaret, Lady Moir, Laura Annie Willson, Margaret Rowbotham, Katharine Parsons, Rachel Parsons and Janetta Mary Ornsby. The first Secretary appointed was Caroline Haslett, who had trained as a boiler-maker during World War One, and was later made a Dame for her services to industry and business. The United States equivalent, the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), was founded in 1950.Through these new opportunities, the 1920s and 1930s in the UK were an active time for women in engineering and WES. In 1923 Elsie Louisa Winterton, a draughtswoman working for the Great Western Railway (GWR) became the first woman member of the Institution of Railway Signal Engineers.In 1924, members of WES, including Caroline Haslett, Margaret Moir and Margaret Partridge founded the Electrical Association for Women. This association aimed to educate women about electricity, providing courses in Electrical Housecraft and demonstrations at electrical showrooms. It published The Electrical Handbook for Women, a guide to electricity, which was re-issued (though with different names) until 1983. That same year, engineering project manager Kathleen M. Butler travelled to London to set up the project offices for the Sydney Harbour Bridge team at Dorman Long, at the same time that Dorothy Donaldson Buchanan started work at the company.\nIn July 1925 the First International Conference of Women in Science, Industry & Commerce was held in London, during the British Empire Exhibition. It was organised by Caroline Haslett & WES, and opened by the Duchess of York in her first public engagement since her marriage into the royal family. Chaired by Lady Astor, the first woman MP to take her seat in the House of Commons, its speakers and attendee list represented key figures in the suffrage and women's rights movements in Britain and abroad, including Millicent Fawcett, Viscountess Rhondda, Kerstin Hesselgren the first woman elected to Upper House of the Swedish parliament and American engineer Ethel H. Bailey.\nAlso in 1925, Annette Ashberry was the first woman to be elected to the UK Society of Engineers and delivered the first address by a woman to the Society's members on 1 November 1926.\nCareers developed in companies such as Metropolitan Vickers in Manchester, where engineer Gertrude Entwisle worked for her entire career. In 1927, Dorothy Donaldson Buchanan successfully passed the admission examination to become the first female member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1929 Winifred Hackett was the first woman to graduate in electrical engineering from the University of Birmingham. By the 1950s Hackett was head of the Guided Weapons Division at aerospace and defence company English Electric.\nIn 1934, pilot and engineer Amy Johnson became the youngest president of WES, serving under her married name of 'Mrs Jim Mollison', four years after becoming the first woman to fly solo from the UK to Australia. That same year, Jeanie Dicks, the first female member of the Electrical Contractors Association, was responsible for the first permanent electrification of Winchester Cathedral. A register of members from 1935 shows the international membership of WES and the variety of different women who were members.\nBefore World War Two, German Jewish engineer Ira Rischowski took refuge in the United Kingdom, becoming a member of WES, having already been in correspondence with them at the start of the War. Because of her German heritage, she was interned as an enemy alien at the Rushen camp on the Isle of Wight but returned to an engineering career once freed in 1942. In 1938, Marja Ludwika Ziff (later known as Maria Watkins) became the first woman to study electrical engineering at the University of Edinburgh, the professor who had offered her a place believing her application was from a Polish man. She later became a defence engineer and university lecturer.\nWomen continued to play an active role in engineering in World War Two and WES were vocal about promoting women's place in industry. Women proved once again their ability to take on roles seen as exclusively for men, while women with formal training in engineering from before the War were able to demonstrate their innovative capacity. Aeronautical engineer Beatrice Shilling, for example, engineered the RAE restrictor for use in Hurricane and Spitfire planes, which had previously been failing during air battle.Isabel Hardwich, electrical engineer and photometry expert joined the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Ltd. in Manchester in 1941, and later became supervisor of technical women within their Research Department, as well as a president of WES.\nAlthough women who had gained engineering opportunities in both industry and the forces during World War Two were forced out of those positions in an almost identical situation to that following World War One, there were enough women sufficiently established in senior roles in government research establishments, such as the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Building Research Establishment and similar, that there continued to be more openings for women. Beatrice Shilling, for instance, remained at the RAE to work on rocket engines and was consulted by NASA on runway surfaces for the future space shuttles. In the same era, Anne Burns introduced the use of strain gauges for inflight testing, contributing to solving the reasons for the Comet airliner crashes of the 1950s.In 1947 Mary Thompson Irvine became the first woman to be elected a chartered member of the Institution of Structural Engineers. In the early 1950s Mary Coombs became the first woman to work on a commercial computer, the LEO computer.  In 1954, Mary Sudbury became the only female engineer to work on the wind tunnels used for supersonic aircraft testing at RAE, and part of the development of Concorde, but still encountered petty misogyny. In 1958 Dorothy Smith, an electrical engineer at Metropolitan-Vickers, was awarded Full Membership of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the first woman since Hertha Ayrton in 1899, to reach this level of membership.\nIn 1962, Steve Shirley founded software company Freelance Programmers with a capital of £6, (later FI, then Xansa, since acquired by Steria and now part of the Sopra Steria Group). Having experienced sexism in her workplace, \"being fondled, being pushed against the wall\", she wanted to create job opportunities for women with dependents, and predominantly employed women, with only three male programmers in the first 300 staff, until the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 made that practice illegal. She also adopted the name \"Steve\" to help her in the male-dominated business world, given that company letters signed using her real name were not responded to. Her team's projects included programming Concorde's black box flight recorder.\nIn 1967, WES led the organisation of the second International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists, held in Cambridge. The conference was attended by delegates from across the globe, with many international speakers, including from African and Asian countries.\nTidal engineer Mary Kendrick began leading the team working on the Thames Barrier in 1968. She later became the first female Acting Conservator of the River Mersey responsible for keeping the River Mersey navigable, a role dating back to 1625.\nIn 1969, Shirley Williams MP, then Minister for Education and Science, launched the first Women in Engineering Year campaign in conjunction with WES to encourage girls and young women to take up engineering as a career.\nAlthough numbers were tiny until the 1970s, increasing numbers of women started to take university degrees and trade qualifications in engineering subjects. It was still a period when a talented person could rise from the technician ranks without a degree, as defence engineer Joan Lavender was able to do at DeHavillands and engineering software designer Judy Butland was able to do at Manchester University and then with her own software business. The defence industry, aviation and the emerging computer hardware and software industries were areas when many women found careers at that time. Examples include Elizabeth Killick, WES presidents Elizabeth Laverick and Peggy Hodges and the founder of the UK's first independent commercial software company, Dina St Johnston.\nIn 1979 the Finniston Report into the engineering profession in the United Kingdom was commissioned by the Labour government. This ultimately led to the foundation of the Engineering Council in 1981, which in its turn collaborated with the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) to launch the Women into Science and Engineering (WISE) year in 1984. Spearheaded by Baroness Beryl Platt, Chair of the EOC and herself an aeronautical engineer, WISE aimed to highlight the career opportunities for girls and women in science and engineering professions. At the time of the launch of WISE, only 7% of engineering graduates in the UK were women.\n",

        "title": "Bug_(engineering)",
        "doc": "In engineering, a bug is a design defect in an engineered system that causes an undesired result.\nAlthough used exclusively to describe a technical issue, bug is a non-technical term; applicable without technical understanding of the system.\nThe term bug applies exclusively to a system that is (human) designed; not to a natural system; and that the issue is within the influence of human control. For example, humans have faults but not bugs, and a server crash due to natural disaster is not a bug.\nIn addition to or instead of defect, some use: error, flaw or fault.\nEngineered systems is a broad classification encompassing but not limited to: software, computer hardware, electronics, circuitry and machinery.\nThe undesirable result can be classified and described many ways including: intermittent, transient, glitch, crash or hang.\nSince desirability is subjective, what is considered undesirable to one may be considered desirable to another; even a useful feature.\nThe Middle English word bugge is the basis for the terms bugbear and bugaboo as terms used for a monster.The term bug to describe a defect has been engineering jargon since at least as far back as the 1870s : long before electronic computers and computer software. For instance, Thomas Edison wrote the following words in a letter to an associate in 1878:\nIt has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then difficulties arise—this thing gives out and [it is] then that \"Bugs\"—as such little faults and difficulties are called—show themselves and months of intense watching, study and labor are requisite before commercial success or failure is certainly reached.\nIn a comic strip printed in a 1924 telephone industry journal, a naive character hears that a man has a job as a \"bug hunter\" and gives a gift of a backscratcher.  The man replies \"don't you know that a 'bug hunter' is just a nickname for a repairman?\"\nBaffle Ball, the first mechanical pinball game, was advertised as being \"free of bugs\" in 1931.\nProblems with military gear during World War II were referred to as bugs (or glitches). \nIn the 1940 film, Flight Command, a defect in a piece of direction-finding gear is called a bug. \nIn a book published in 1942, Louise Dickinson Rich, speaking of a powered ice cutting machine, said, \"Ice sawing was suspended until the creator could be brought in to take the bugs out of his darling.\"\nIsaac Asimov used the term bug to relate to issues with a robot in his short story \"Catch That Rabbit\", published in 1944.\nComputer pioneer and rear admiral, Grace Hopper, popularized a story about a moth that caused a problem in an early electromechanical computer. While Hopper was working on the Mark II and Mark III as Harvard faculty in about 1947, operators traced an error in the Mark II to a moth trapped in a relay. The moth was removed from the mechanism and taped in a log book with the note \"First actual case of bug being found.\"\nReportedly, the operators, including William \"Bill\" Burke, later of the Naval Weapons Laboratory, Dahlgren, Virginia,  were familiar with the engineering term and probably making a joke by conflating the two meanings of bug (biological and defect).\nAlthough probably a joke, the story indicates that the term was commonly used in the computer field at that time. \nThe log book, complete with moth, is part of the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.\nThe related term debug also appears to predate its usage in computing: the Oxford English Dictionary's etymology of the word contains an attestation from 1945, in the context of aircraft engines.\nSince bug implies undesirable behavior, calling a behavior a bug is subjective. Behavior which is considered a bug by some may be considered a useful feature by others,hence a common phrase is \"It's not a bug, it's a feature\" (INABIAF). This quip is recorded in The Jargon File dating to 1975 but dates to 1971 when PDP-8 programmer Sandra Lee Harris at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) made the distinction between issues to be fixed in the code for DEC's FOCAL interpreter and those to be documented or clarified in the user manual.\nSuch behavior might be explicitly communicated to users, or might remain an undocumented feature.\n",

        "doc": "The Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the United Kingdom trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, dimension stone, lime, mortar, and silica sand industries.\nThe MPA, with the affiliation of the British Association of Reinforcement, British Calcium Carbonates Federation, Eurobitume UK, and United Kingdom Quality Ash Association, has a growing membership of 520 companies and is the sectoral voice for mineral products. MPA membership is made up of the vast majority of independent SME quarrying companies throughout the UK, as well as the nine major international and global companies. It covers 100% of UK cement production, 90% of aggregates production, 95% of asphalt and over 70% of ready-mixed concrete and precast concrete production. Each year the industry supplies £22 billion worth of materials and services to the UK economy and is the largest supplier to the construction industry, which has annual output valued at £144 billion. Industry production represents the largest materials flow in the UK economy and is also one of the largest manufacturing sectors.The MPA was formed in March 2009 from the merger of the Quarry Products Association, the British Cement Association and The Concrete Centre. It was officially launched in June 2009.The MPA has offices in London, Glasgow and Fron in Wales.QPA Northern Ireland is affiliated to the MPA and has offices in Crumlin, County Antrim. The British Precast Concrete Federation (BPCF), the trade association of precast concrete manufacturers, is a member of the MPA and is based in Leicester.\nThe MPA has regional divisions, for London & South East, South West, East Anglia, Midlands, Wales, North, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThe Concrete Centre was formed in 2003 and since 2009 has been part of the MPA. The Concrete Centre promotes the use of concrete in construction through the provision of resources to enable designers to follow best practice for the design of concrete and masonry. The Concrete Centre publishes a journal, Concrete Quarterly which was first published by the Cement and Concrete Association in 1947. The journal showcases the use of concrete in construction projects in the United Kingdom and worldwide. The CQ archive is available online.",

        "title": "Resilience_week",
        "doc": "Resilience week is an annual symposium established to enable cross-disciplinary and role based discussions to advance strategies and research that engenders resilience in critical infrastructure systems and communities. Damaging storms, cyber attack and the interconnection of critical infrastructure systems can lead to cascading events that not only affect local but also across regions. However, many of these interdependencies are not easily recognized and obscure and complicate the mitigation of risk. The purpose of the symposia series is hence to facilitate best practice in managing critical infrastructure risks, by bringing together businesses, government  and researchers.\nOriginally organized in 2008 as a focus on the new research area of resilient control systems, including the disciplinary areas of control system, cyber-security, cognitive psychology and any number of critical infrastructure domains. Resilience has long been recognized as an area that requires not only the contributions of multiple disciplines or multidisciplinary participation, but interdisciplinary interaction where there is a common language and familiarity of the contributors to what other disciplines (and roles) contribute. The resulting interactions developed by Resilience Week and associated activities are intended to culture this sharing environment as a safe zone for inclusion; more importantly, an environment that lends to developing the new science and practice.As the attributes of resilience are complex, the contributions and topics for the event have included both the disciplinary and the project considerations, in keynotes, panels and research presentations. Keynotes have included senior leadership in the Department of Energy, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies in addition to National Academy and professional organization fellows and senior industry leaders. Project panels and research presentations include emergent topics in resilience to climate change, cyber attack, damaging storms and the energy assurance.   \nProceedings are developed for each year of the event, documenting the diversity of the research and engagements within these topical areas.\nSince its inception, the Resilience Week community has evolved from one that primarily included only university researchers to one that includes many government laboratories, universities    and private industries  in the US and internationally. This type of collaboration forms a feedback loop that informs the research with the current needs and hones best practices. The future of the event is to further advance discussions that advance investment, recognize priorities and expedite technologies and tools to proactively address  our energy future, in light of the natural and manmade challenges, and rationalizing the complex relationships that exist in critical infrastructure.",

        "doc": "Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics, and Science (TEAMS) is an annual competition originally organized by the Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS). TEAMS is an annual theme-based competition for students in grades 9:12, aimed at giving them the opportunity to discover engineering and how they can make a difference in the world.\nThe TEAMS competition was created in 1975 at the University of Illinois for the state of Illinois. In 1978, JETS expanded TEAMS to become a national competition. In 1993, the TEAMS test changed format into a format very similar to the one used today. Since 2008, the TEAMS competitions have had a theme.The 2010 theme for the TEAMS competition delved in the problems engineers face while providing access to clean water. It was named for Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous quote, \"Water, water, everywhere, / Nor any drop to drink.\"\nThis competition is divided in two parts. The first part, lasting an hour and a half, has 80 multiple choice questions. Each group of ten questions is related to a specific problem relating to the overall theme. The second part consists of eight open-ended tasks that are aimed at encouraging teamwork to develop the best answer. This competition is taken part by each participating school in a regional competition; the scores at that date determine the standings in the regional, state, and national level. There are six school divisions, one home division, one group division and two levels (9th/10th grade level & 11th/12th grade level).Each team consists of eight high school students. A school may submit multiple teams. Thousands of teams participate in this competition each year.\n",

Loss in weight\nThis type of gravimetric blender measures the \"loss in weight\" from two or more hoppers using a load cell under each hopper. Material is usually dispensed from the hoppers using a screw conveyor. All materials are dispensed together and the rate of dosing from each hopper is controlled to ensure the correct blend is achieved.\n2. Gain in weight (sometimes called a batch blender)\nA gain in weight gravimetric blender has two or more hoppers arranged above a weigh-pan. These hoppers contain the components which are to be mixed, at the base of each hopper there is a valve to control the dispensing of material from the component hopper into the weigh-pan. The components are dispensed one at a time into the weigh pan until the target or batch weight is reached. Once the batch has been weighed out the contents of the weigh-pan are dispensed into a mixing chamber where they are blended. The resulting mixture exits the base of the mixing chamber into the processing machine.\nA typical application of a gravimetric blender would be mixing virgin plastic granules, recycled plastic, and masterbatch (an additive used to colour plastics) together.\n",

It also sets the administrative procedures requirements for the \"conformity assessment\" of pressure equipment, for the free placing on the European market without local legislative barriers. It has been mandatory throughout the EU since 30 May 2002, with 2014 revision fully effective as of 19 July 2016. The standards and regulations regarding pressure vessels and boiler safety are also very close to the US standards defined by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). This enables most international inspection agencies to provide both verification and certification services to assess compliance to the different pressure equipment directives. From the pressure vessel manufactures PED does not generally require a prior manufacturing permit/certificate/stamp as ASME does.\n",

        "title": "ARP4761",
        "doc": "ARP4761, Guidelines for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process on Civil Aircraft, Systems, and Equipment is an Aerospace Recommended Practice from SAE International. In conjunction with ARP4754, ARP4761 is used to demonstrate compliance with  14 CFR 25.1309 in the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness regulations for transport category aircraft, and also harmonized international airworthiness regulations such as European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) CS:25.1309.\nThis Recommended Practice defines a process for using common modeling techniques to assess the safety of a system being put together. The first 30 pages of the document covers that process. The next 140 pages give an overview of the modeling techniques and how they should be applied. The last 160 pages give an example of the process in action.\nSome of the methods covered:\nFunctional Hazard Assessment (FHA)\nPreliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA)\nSystem Safety Assessment (SSA)\nFault Tree Analysis (FTA)\nFailure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)\nFailure Modes and Effects Summary (FMES)\nCommon Cause Analysis (CCA), consisting of:\nZonal Safety Analysis (ZSA)\nParticular Risks Analysis (PRA)\nCommon Mode Analysis (CMA)\nThe general flow of the safety life cycle under ARP4761 is:Perform the aircraft level FHA in parallel with development of aircraft level requirements.\nPerform the system level FHA in parallel with allocation of aircraft functions to system functions, and initiate the CCA.\nPerform the PSSA in parallel with system architecture development, and update the CCA.\nIterate the CCA and PSSA as the system is allocated into hardware and software components.\nPerform the SSA in parallel with system implementation, and complete the CCA.\nFeed the results into the certification process.\nThe Functional Safety process is focused on identifying functional failure conditions leading to hazards. Functional Hazard Analyses / Assessments are central to determining hazards. FHA is performed early in aircraft design, first as an Aircraft Functional Hazard Analysis (AFHA) and then as a System Functional Hazard Analysis (SFHA). Using qualitative assessment, aircraft functions and subsequently aircraft system functions are systematically analyzed for failure conditions, and each failure condition is assigned a hazard classification. Hazard classifications are closely related to Development Assurance Levels (DALs) and are aligned between ARP4761 and related aviation safety documents such as ARP4754A, 14 CFR 25.1309, and Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) standards DO-254 and DO-178B. \nFHA results are normally shown in spreadsheet form, with columns identifying function, failure condition, phase of flight, effect, hazard classification, DAL, means of detection, aircrew response, and related information. Each hazard is assigned a unique identifier that is tracked throughout the entire safety life cycle. One approach is to identify systems by their ATA system codes and the corresponding hazards by derivative identifiers. For example, the thrust reverser system could be identified by its ATA code 78-30. Untimely deployment of thrust reverser would be a hazard, which could be assigned an identifier based on ATA code 78-30.\nFHA results are coordinated with the system design process as aircraft functions are allocated to aircraft systems. The FHA also feeds into the PSSA, which is prepared while the system architecture is developed.\nThe PSSA may contain qualitative FTA, which can be used to identify systems requiring redundancy so that catastrophic events do not result from a single failure (or dual failure where one is latent). A fault tree is prepared for each SFHA hazard rated hazardous or catastrophic. Fault trees may be performed for major hazards if warranted. DALs and specific safety design requirements are imposed on the subsystems. The safety design requirements are captured and traced. These may include preventive or mitigation strategies selected for particular subsystems. The PSSA and CCA generate separation requirements to identify and eliminate common mode failures. Subsystem failure rate budgets are assigned so that hazard probability limits can be met.\nThe CCA consists of three separate types of analyses which are designed to uncover hazards not created by a specific subsystem component failure. The CCA may be many separate documents, may be one CCA document, or may be included as sections in the SSA document. The Particular Risk Analysis (PRA) looks for external events which can create a hazard such as a birdstrike or engine turbine burst. The Zonal Safety Analysis (ZSA) looks at each compartment on the aircraft and looks for hazards that can affect every component in that compartment, such as loss of cooling air or a fluid line bursting. The Common Mode Analysis (CMA) looks at the redundant critical components to find failure modes which can cause all to fail at about the same time. Software is always included in this analysis as well as looking for manufacturing errors or \"bad lot\" components. A failure such as a bad resistor in all flight control computers would be addressed here. The mitigations for CMA discoveries is often DO-254 or DO-178B components.\nThe SSA includes quantitative FMEA, which is summarized into FMES. Normally FMES probabilities are used in quantitative FTA to demonstrate that the hazard probability limits are in fact met. Cutset analysis of the fault trees demonstrates that no single failure condition will result in a hazardous or catastrophic event. The SSA may include the results of all safety analysis and be one document or may be many documents. An FTA is only one method for performing the SSA. Other methods include dependence diagram or reliability block diagram and Markov Analysis.\nThe PSSA and CCA often result in recommendations or design requirements to improve the system. The SSA summarizes the residual risks remaining in the system and should show all hazards meet the 1309 failure rates.\nThe ARP4761 analyses also feed into Crew Alerting System (CAS) message selection and the development of critical maintenance tasks under ATA MSG3.\nIn 2004, SAE Standard Committee S-18 began working on Revision A to ARP4761. When released, EUROCAE plans to jointly issue the document as ED:135.",

        "doc": "An engineering technologist is a professional trained in certain aspects of development and implementation of a respective area of technology. An education in engineering technology concentrates more on application and less on theory than does an engineering education. Engineering technologists often assist engineers; but after years of experience, they can also become engineers. Like engineers, areas where engineering technologists can work include product design, fabrication, and testing. Engineering technologists sometimes rise to senior management positions in industry or become entrepreneurs.\nEngineering technologists are more likely than engineers to focus on post-development implementation, product manufacturing, or operation of technology. The American National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) makes the distinction that engineers are trained in conceptual skills, to \"function as designers\", while engineering technologists \"apply others' designs\". The mathematics and sciences, as well as other technical courses, in engineering technology programs, are taught with more application-based examples, whereas engineering coursework provides a more theoretical foundation in math and science. Moreover, engineering coursework tends to require higher-level mathematics including calculus and calculus-based theoretical science courses, as well as more extensive knowledge of the natural sciences, which serves to prepare students for research (whether in graduate studies or industrial R&D) as opposed to engineering technology coursework which focuses on algebra, trigonometry, applied calculus, and other courses that are more practical than theoretical in nature and generally have more labs that involve the hands-on application of the topics studied.\nIn the United States, although some states require, without exception, a BS degree in engineering at schools with programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), about two-thirds of the states accept BS degrees in engineering technology accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of the ABET, in order to become licensed as professional engineers. States have different requirements as to the years of experience needed to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Professional Engineering (PE) exams. A few states require those sitting for the exams to have a master's degree in engineering. This education model is in line with the educational system in the United Kingdom where an accredited MEng or MSc degree in engineering is required by the Engineering Council (EngC) to be registered as a Chartered Engineer. Engineering technology graduates with can earn an MS degree in engineering technology, engineering, engineering management, construction management, or a National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB)-accredited Master of Architecture degree. These degrees are also offered online or through distance-learning programs at various universities, both nationally and internationally, which allows individuals to continue working full-time while earning an advanced degree.\nEngineering technologists are more likely to work in testing, fabrication/construction or fieldwork, while engineers generally focus more on conceptual design and product development, with considerable overlap (e.g., testing and fabrication are often integral to the overall product development process and can involve engineers as well as engineering technologists).Engineering technologists are employed in a wide array of industries and areas including product development, manufacturing and maintenance. They may become managers depending upon the experience and their educational emphasis on management. Entry-level positions relating in various ways to product design, product testing, product development, systems development, field engineering, technical operations, and quality control are common for engineering technologists. Most companies generally make no distinction between engineers and engineering technologists when it comes to hiring.\nBeginning in the 1950s and 1960s, some post-secondary institutions in the U.S. and Canada began offering degrees in engineering technology, focusing on applied study rather than the more theoretical studies required for engineering degrees. The focus on applied study addressed a need within the scientific, manufacturing, and engineering communities, as well as other industries, for professionals with hands-on and applications-based engineering knowledge. Depending on the institution, associate's or bachelor's degrees are offered, with some institutions also offering advanced degrees in engineering technology.In general, an engineering technologist receives a broad range of applied science and applied mathematics training, as well as the fundamentals of engineering in the student's area of focus. Engineering technology programs typically include instruction in providing support to specific engineering specialties. Information technology is primarily involved with the management, operation, and maintenance of computer systems and networks, along with an application of technology in diverse fields such as architecture, engineering, graphic design, telecommunications, computer science, and network security. An engineering technologist is also expected to have had some coursework in ethics.\nIn 2001, Professional organizations from different countries have signed a mutual recognition agreement called the Sydney Accord, which represents an understanding that the academic credentials of engineering technologists will be recognized in all signatory states. The recognition given engineering technologists under the Sydney Accord can be compared to the Washington Accord for engineers and the Dublin Accord for engineering technicians. The Engineering Technologist Mobility Forum (ETMF) is an international forum held by signatories of the Sydney Accord to explore mutual recognition for experienced engineering technologists and to remove artificial barriers to the free movement and practice of engineering technologists amongst their countries. ETMF can be compared to the Engineers Mobility Forum (EMF) for engineers.\nGraduates acquiring an associate degree, or lower, typically find careers as engineering technicians. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics: \"Many four-year colleges offer bachelor's degrees in engineering technology and graduates of these programs are hired to work as entry-level engineers or applied engineers, but not technicians.\" Engineering technicians typically have a two-year associate degree, while engineering technologists have a bachelor's degrees.\nIn Canada, the new occupational category of \"technologist\" was established in the 1960s, in conjunction with an emerging system of community colleges and technical institutes. It was designed to effectively bridge the gap between the increasingly theoretical nature of engineering degrees and the predominantly practical approach of technician and trades programs. Provincial associations may certify individuals as a professional technologist (P.Tech.), certified engineering technologist (C.E.T.), registered engineering technologist (R.E.T.), applied science technologist (AScT), or technologue professionel (T.P.). These provincial associations are constituent members of Technology Professionals Canada (TPC), which accredits technology programs across Canada, through its Technology Accreditation Canada (TAC). Nationally accredited engineering technology programs range from two to three years in length, depending on the province, and often require as many classroom hours as a 4-year degree program.In the United States, the U.S. Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) are at the top of the educational accreditation hierarchy. The U.S. Department of Education acknowledges regional and national accreditation and CHEA recognizes specialty accreditation. One technology accreditation is currently recognized by CHEA: The Association of Technology, Management and Applied Engineering (ATMAE). CHEA recognizes ATMAE for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States. As of March 2019, ABET withdrew from CHEA recognitionThe National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET) awards certification at two levels, depending on work experience: the Associate Engineering Technologist (AT) and the Certified Engineering Technologist (CT). ATMAE awards two levels of certification in technology management: Certified Technology Manager (CTM) and Certified Senior Technology Manager (CSTM). ATMAE also awards two levels of certification of manufacturing specialist: Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS) and Certified Senior Manufacturing Specialist (CSMS). In 2020, ATMAE announced offering the Certified Controls Engineer (CCE) and Certified Senior Controls Engineer (CSCE) professional certifications. While the CTM, CMS, and CCE certifications are obtained through examination, the CSTM, CSMS and CSCE require industry experience and continuous improvement via the obtainment of professional development units (PDUs).\nThe American Society of Certified Engineering Technicians (ASCET) is a membership organization that issues Certified Member certifications to engineering technicians and engineering technologists. Professional engineers are issued Registered Member certification.\nThe United Kingdom has a decades-long tradition of producing engineering technologists via the apprenticeship system. UK engineering technologists have always been designated as \"engineers\", which in the UK is used to describe the entire range of skilled workers and professionals, from tradespeople through to the highly educated Chartered Engineer. In fact up until the 1960s professional engineers in the UK were often referred to as \"Technologists\" to distinguish them from scientists, technicians, and craftsmen. The modern term for an engineering technologist is \"incorporated engineer\" (IEng), although since 2000 the normal route to achieving IEng is with a bachelor's or honors degree in engineering. Modern technical apprenticeships would normally lead to the engineering technician (EngTech) professional qualification and, with further studies at higher apprenticeship level, an IEng. Since 2015, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has introduced engineering degree (bachelors and masters) apprenticeships. The title \"incorporated engineer\" is protected by civil law. Prior to the title \"incorporated engineer\", UK technologists were known as \"technician engineers\" a designation introduced in the 1960s.In the United Kingdom, an incorporated engineer is accepted as a \"professional engineer\", registered by the EngC, although the term \"professional engineer\" has no legal meaning in the UK and there are no restrictions on the practice. In fact, anyone in the UK can call themselves an \"engineer\" or \"professional engineer\" without any qualifications or proven competence in engineering; and most UK skilled trades are sometimes referred to as \"professional\" or \"accredited\" engineers. Examples are \"Registered Gas Engineer\" (gas installer) or \"Professional Telephone Engineer\" (phone line installer or fault diagnosis).\nIncorporated engineers are recognized internationally under the Sydney Accord as engineering technologists. One of the professional titles recognized by the Washington Accord for engineers in the United Kingdom is the chartered engineer. The incorporated engineer is a professional engineer as recognized by the EngC of the United Kingdom. The European designation, as demonstrated by the prescribed title under 2005/36/EC, is \"engineer\". The incorporated engineer operates autonomously and directs activities independently. They do not necessarily need the support of chartered engineers, because they are often acknowledged as full engineers in the UK (but not in Canada or the U.S.). The United Kingdom incorporated engineer may also contribute to the design of new products and systems.\nThe chartered engineer and incorporated engineer, whilst often undertaking similar roles, are distinct qualifications awarded by the EngC, with Chartered Engineer (CEng) status being the terminal engineering qualification.\nIncorporated engineers currently require an IEng-accredited bachelors or honors degree in engineering (prior to 1997 the B.Sc. and B.Eng. degrees satisfied the academic requirements for \"chartered engineer\" registration), a Higher National Certificate or diploma, City and Guilds of London Institute higher diploma/full technological cert diploma, or a Foundation Degree in engineering, plus appropriate further learning to degree level, or an NVQ4 or SVQ4 qualifications approved for the purpose by a licensed engineering institution.\nThe academic requirements must be accompanied by the appropriate peer-reviewed experience in employment—typically 4 years post qualification. In addition to the experience and academic requirements, the engineering candidate must have three referees (themselves CEng or IEng) who vouch for the performance of the individual being considered for professional recognition. There are a number of alternative ways to achieve IEng status for those that do not have the necessary qualifications for applicants, but who can clearly show they have achieved the same level as those with qualifications, including:\nwriting a technical report, based upon their experience and demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of engineering principles;\nearning the City and Guilds graduate diploma (bachelors level) and a postgraduate diploma (masters level) accredited by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) and Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE);\nfollowing a work-based learning program;\nor  taking an academic program specified by the institution to which they are applying.\nThe engineering technologist (state-certified technician; German: Staatlich geprüfter Techniker) are vocational (non-academic) qualifications at the tertiary level in Germany. The degree is governed by the framework agreement of trade and technical schools (resolution of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the states in the Federal Republic of Germany of 7 November 2002 in its respective applicable version) and is recognised by all states of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is awarded after passing state examinations at state or state-recognised technical school or academies (German: Fachschule/Fachakademie). Through the Vocational Training Modernisation Act (12.12.2019), state-certified engineers are also allowed to hold the title Bachelor Professional in Technik as of 1 January 2020.To be eligible for the engineering technologist examination, candidates must fulfill the following requirements: completion of one of the school systems (Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium), an apprenticeship of at least two years duration, one year of completed professional work experience and attendance of an educational program with a course load of 2400:3000 hours, usually completed within two years, full-time, or 3.5:4 years, part-time, at vocational colleges.\nAs of 31 January 2012, state-certified engineers, state-certified business managers and state-certified designers are at level 6-bachelor in the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), equivalent to a bachelor's degree. As such, the engineering technologist constitutes an advanced entry qualification for German universities and in principle permits entry into any undergraduate academic-degree program.The qualifications are listed in EU Directives as recognised, regulated professions in Germany and the EU. Annexes C and D were added to Council Directive 92/51/EEC as a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC.\nInstitutions involved included the federal government (in Germany, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology), EU Standing Conference and Economic Ministerial Meeting of Countries, the German Chamber of Crafts, the Confederation of German Employers' Associations, German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, Confederation of German Trade Unions, and the Federal Institute for Vocational Application. These government institutions agreed on a common position regarding the implementation of the EQF and a German qualifications framework (DQR).\n",

        "doc": "Amasa Stone Bishop (1921 : May 21, 1997) was an American nuclear physicist specializing in fusion physics. He received his B.S. in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1943. From 1943 to 1946 he was a member of the staff of Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was involved with radar research and development. Later, he became a staff member of the University of California at Berkeley from 1946 to 1950. Specializing in high energy particle work, he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1950.\nAfter attaining his Ph.D., Amasa spent three years in Switzerland, acting as research associate at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, and later at the University of Zürich. In 1953 Amasa joined the research division of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Washington and became the director of the American program to develop controlled fusion, also known as Project Sherwood. He was later presented the AEC Outstanding Service Award for his work. After leaving this position in 1956, Amasa published a book on behalf of the AEC discussing the various attempts at harnessing fusion under Project Sherwood. The book, \"Project Sherwood: The U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion\", was published in 1958.\nAfter 1956 Amasa also served as the AEC's European scientific representative, based in Paris. He was also an assistant delegate to the European atomic energy agency, Euratom, in Brussels. Later he spent several years in Princeton, New Jersey, and was in charge of the fusion program in Washington.\nIn 1970 Amasa joined the United Nations in Europe as director of environment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. During this position, he worked with scientists and diplomats to create solutions for various environmental problems. He left this position to retire in 1980. Amasa died on May 21, 1997, of pneumonia related to Alzheimer's disease at the Clinique de Genolier in Genolier, Switzerland.\nBishop was the great-grandson of Industrialist Amasa Stone.\n",

        "title": "Social_practice",
        "doc": "Social practice is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations. Emphasized as a commitment to change, social practice occurs in two forms: activity and inquiry. Most often applied within the context of human development, social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices.\nThrough research, Sylvia Scribner sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position, race, gender, and social class. Using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation, Scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings. She therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development.Social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner-community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills, knowledge, and understanding of people in their private, family, community, and working lives. In this approach to social practice, activity is used for social change without the agenda of research. Activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community.Within research, social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual. Just as social practice is an activity itself, inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes. It has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers' commitments to specific forms of social action.In education, social practice refers to the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others. Under social practice, literacy is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda.  In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and numeracy are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse, many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions. Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other. As such, they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text, institution, and individual. Overall, literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction, poetry, politics, and history.Social practice is also considered a medium for making art. Social practice art came about in response to increasing pressure within art education to work collaboratively through social and participatory formats from artists' desires and art viewers' increasing media sophistication. \"Social practice art\" is a term for artwork that uses social engagement as a primary medium, and is also referred to by a range of different names: socially engaged art, community art, new-genre public art, participatory art, interventionist art, and collaborative art.\nArtists working in the medium of social practice develop projects by inviting collaboration with individuals, communities, institutions, or a combination of these, creating participatory art that exists both within and outside of the traditional gallery and museum system. Artists working in social practice art co-create their work with a specific audience or propose critical interventions within existing social systems that inspire debate or catalyze social exchange. Social practice art work focuses on the interaction between the audience, social systems, and the artist through topics such as aesthetics, ethics, collaboration, persona, media strategies, and social activism. The social interaction component inspires, drives, or, in some instances, completes the project. Although projects may incorporate traditional studio media, they are realized in a variety of visual or social forms (depending on variable contexts and participant demographics) such as performance, social activism, or mobilizing communities towards a common goal.\n",

        "doc": "Uncertainty management theory (UMT), developed by Dale Brashers, addresses the concept of uncertainty management. Several theories have been developed in an attempt to define uncertainty, identify its effects and establish strategies for managing it. Uncertainty management theory was the first theory to decline the idea that uncertainty is negative. It was developed and has been applied considering uncertainty neutral; neither positive nor negative. Although viewed as neutral, researchers of uncertainty management propose that uncertainty can be utilized strategically for beneficial purposes while also acknowledging that the effects of uncertainty can be harmful, espousing an approach that requires examination of each situation, the parties involved, the issues at stake and the desired objectives for determining the best method for managing uncertainty, with reduction being one of the many management techniques.\nUncertainty Management Theory (UMT) was developed by Dale Brashers, an associate professor of Speech Communication at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.  Brashers died in 2010 after spending more than 20 years researching uncertainty management.  Before Brashers' work, the most prominent literature in the field of uncertainty management was that of Charles Berger. Berger's Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT) continues to be the dominant theory of uncertainty management, with much of the additional work on this topic being a continuation of Berger's research. This includes the work of William Gudykunst, who continued with Berger's line of thinking, partnering together with him on Anxiety-Uncertainty Management (AUM) theory. Both of these theories focus on the idea that uncertainty produces anxiety. Because of the anxiety produced by heightened levels of uncertainty, individuals are highly motivated to reduce uncertainty. Uncertainty Reduction posits that individuals would rather receive bad news than continue in a state of uncertainty. This thinking was widely accepted, with uncertainty being studied almost exclusively through this lens before the introduction of UMT. With UMT, Brashers established that to fully understand the effects of uncertainty and how uncertainty contributes to various aspects of human life humanity must first move away from the idea that all uncertainty is negative. Brashers approached uncertainty as neutral (neither good nor bad), acknowledging that uncertainty reduction is one of many possible responses to situations that are lacking in the information necessary for full understanding. Brashers notes, however, that individuals will sometimes choose to remain in a state of uncertainty even though reduction opportunities are available.Uncertainty is an unavoidable aspect of everyday life. The degree to which it is felt in a given situation varies among individuals. Because uncertainty is dependent upon perspective, \"a person who believes himself or herself to be uncertain is uncertain.\" However, people have different appetites and tolerances for uncertainty. For some, the existence of uncertainty is stimulating or perhaps even exhilarating, whereas others can be highly motivated to reduce even the slightest degree of uncertainty. The idea of exhilarating uncertainty could best be illustrated by an individual's decision to participate in an extreme recreational activity such as skydiving, bungee jumping or parasailing. Personal tolerance for uncertainty will determine how willing a person is to invest when the likelihood of the desired outcome is unclear; whether this investment is monetary, relational or otherwise. Babrow (1992) applied this principle to research around uncertainty and probability, stating that uncertainty is at its peak when the probability of the outcome is at or near 50%; while extremely low or extremely high probability reduces uncertainty.Interpersonal relationships have great application to the field of uncertainty management and arguably the widest appeal since everyone participates in the process of relating to others. In the initial stage of relationship development, individuals engage in heightened observation of the other party to reduce uncertainty about the suitability of the relationship's future. Individuals engage in self-disclosure and other forms of interaction, particularly in the early stages of relationships, often for the sole purpose of exploring how the other party will respond. Much of the research and writing on relational communication focuses on the idea that through interaction, society comes to learn more about itself and others. The focus of uncertainty management has been not only on how people interact, but how they gather information about other people through interaction, what is done with that information, and why it is done. UMT posits that even in the early stages of relationship, one might choose to not self-disclose or to not seek self-disclosure to allow a level of uncertainty to remain.Uncertainty is generally the result of a situation being unclear, unpredictable and/or complicated, with needed information being scarce or contradictory, and the people involved lacking confidence in the amount or reliability of the information they possess about this situation. A state of uncertainty can be temporary or long-term. In relationship development, uncertainty is generally reduced at a rapid pace early in the relationship as the two parties get to know one another. This slows as the relationship progresses and the parties have fewer withheld disclosures to present. The slowdown can also be the result of one or both of the parties reaching the desired level of intimacy and thus withholding additional personal information to not further the development of the relationship. Although this withholding reduces uncertainty around where the relationship is going, it can increase uncertainty or at least maintain uncertainty levels for the other party about the areas of the individual's life and being that are no longer being disclosed. Uncertainty is often the result of multiple contributing factors that are connected to how they can affect different aspects of an individual's life. The same can be true for the functioning of an organization.  \nIn relationships, individuals are motivated to explore two types of uncertainty. First, predictive uncertainty reveals what one can expect from the other party going forward. An individual desires to be able to predict with some degree of certainty how the other party is going to behave in a specific circumstance or how they are going to respond to information the individual discloses. Second, explanatory uncertainty serves to identify the reasons behind past behavior. People want to be able to make sense of the other party's words or behavior. If their behavior is undesirable and the individual can identify what prompted that behavior, they can alter their behavior or words to not continue prompting the behavior they no longer desire from the other party.\nUMT applies across a wide spectrum of topics and experiences, most notably health, organizational and interpersonal settings.Healthcare, and particularly health communication, is an arena for UMT. Researchers studying health have employed UMT as a way to understand and communicate processes including medicine, technology, payer concerns and political ramifications. This work has resulted in what Brashers referred to as the \"culture of chronic illness,\" where constant testing and evaluation of people's health almost always results in the identification of some level of sickness, infection or disease; resulting in two groups of people: the \"chronically ill\" and the \"worried well.\" Much work was completed in the late 1990s regarding the effect of uncertainty on the rapidly increasing HIV diagnosed population. Uncertainty was of particular concern with the communication methods that were utilized by healthcare providers with their HIV patients. The role of medical malpractice litigation has also contributed to the complexity of communication between healthcare providers and patients regarding diagnosis and treatment options.Although not as frequently cited, UMT also has widespread applicability to the organizational setting (i.e., the workplace). Research in this setting has included examining the role of uncertainty in unhealthy workplace behavior. Other work has examined expected employee behaviors, channels of communication and deviant employee behavior. In looking at uncertainty in the context of the workplace, Brashers relates uncertainty to ambiguity where there are multiple explanations of behavior or phenomenon; he further states that \"ambiguity is not always undesired and individuals sometimes use it for strategic purposes.\" Sometimes these strategies are for self-preservation or the retention of power, where individuals create and/or maintain ambiguity to protect their status quo. This same line of thinking has been applied to perpetrators in the workplace who cloud inappropriate behavior with enough uncertainty to disguise what would otherwise be viewed as sexual harassment. It is important to note that other uncertainty management theorists, particularly those who view uncertainty as an unhealthy dynamic. view the workplace as the primary venue in need of uncertainty reduction. This argument is particularly relevant when evaluating uncertainty around the decision-making process for organizations.People in relationships can frequently experience uncertainty. This uncertainty is not only related to the other party, but even self behavior imposes uncertainty on our relationships that often are unintended. Whether it is the result of notable cultural differences or simply family influence in the way individuals relate to others or show affection, these differences leave the other party guessing at to their intended meaning. Not all uncertainty is negative. Many individuals value the spontaneity that results from some degree of uncertainty in interpersonal relationships or how those relationships are managed.",
