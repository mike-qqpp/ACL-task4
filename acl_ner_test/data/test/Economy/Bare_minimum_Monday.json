    "document": "Bare minimum Monday (BMM), also known as minimum effort Monday or minimal Mondays refers to an initiative by employees to do the minimal amount of work necessary on Mondays, which mark the start of the work week. This may also involve starting the work day later and prioritizing self-care activities. In doing so, employees alleviate the stress and anxiety associated with the beginning of the work week by making Mondays more manageable and less overwhelming.\nThe term was coined in 2022 by Marisa Jo Mayes on TikTok under the username \"itsmarisajo\" in response to occupational burnout from the Sunday scaries, hustle culture, and worker exploitation.\nBare minimum Monday has been criticized as an antiwork effort and that employee disengagement could lead to termination of employment. Bare minimum Monday is not compatible with company cultures that promote presenteeism.\n",
