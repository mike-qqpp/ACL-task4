    "document": "The relationship between Christianity and animal rights is complex, with different Christian communities coming to different conclusions about the status of animals. The topic is closely related to, but broader than, the practices of Christian vegetarians and the various Christian environmentalist movements.\nMany Christian philosophers and socio-political figures have stated that Christians should follow the example of Jesus and treat animals in a way that expresses compassion and demonstrates the respectful stewardship of humanity over the environment. William Wilberforce, a co-founder of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, is an example. Large organizations in which a variety of different groups work together, such as the Humane Society of the United States, have undertaken religious outreach using such arguments.\nAndrew Linzey has pointed out it would be wrong to see Christianity as an inherent enemy of animal rights since Christian theology, like all other religious traditions, has some unique insights into viewing animal life as having fundamental value.\nThroughout history, there have been Christian thinkers who have raised ethical questions about the moral status of animals. Francis of Assisi is perhaps the most well-known example.\nVarious church founders have recommended vegetarianism for ethical reasons, such as William Cowherd from the Bible Christian Church, Ellen G. White from the Seventh-day Adventists and John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. Cowherd helped to establish the world's first Vegetarian Society in 1847. Wesley's vegetarian views inspired a later generation to establish the American Vegetarian Society in 1850. Christian denominations like Seventh Day Adventists have central vegetarian doctrines incorporated.\nAlthough animal sacrifice is a theme in the Old Testament, the rise of Christianity brought an end to animal sacrifice in communities where it took hold. The concept of the Peaceable Kingdom found in the Hebrew Bible, describes peaceful coexistence of animals such as wolves and lambs.\n",
