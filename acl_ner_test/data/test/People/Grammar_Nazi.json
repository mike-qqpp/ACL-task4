    "document": "Grammar nazi/spelling nazi or grammar pedant/spelling pedant is a term for a pedant who compulsively criticizes or corrects others' grammar mistakes, typos, misspellings, and other errors in speech or writing. The term originated in 1990s discussion forums as a way to insult those who overly correct others' grammar. \"Grammar Nazis\" often correct mistakes humorously, though this can reinforce arbitrary standards of linguistic correctness. These corrections often reflect literacy privilege. The term is often criticized for being a lighthearted use of the word Nazi. Grammar nazis are often criticized themselves for being rude or harsh.\nThe Nazis were the German government and military responsible for the Holocaust during World War II. They were extremely authoritarian. By the 1950s-60s, \"nazi,\" when written in lowercase, became a term for anyone seen as extremely authoritarian. Early examples include \"surf nazis\" who were fanatical about surfing. The term \"grammar nazi\" appeared on a Usenet forum as early as 1990, and gained wider recognition after the \"Soup Nazi\" character on Seinfeld in 1995.With the spread of social media, grammar nazis have become more common, as it is easier than ever to correct typos and misspellings. Grammar nazis are particularly prevalent on Facebook, Reddit, and X (Twitter).In 2016, Reese Lansangan released the song Grammar Nazi about a woman upset with her love interest's grammar. The song went viral and is even used to teach English. The song Word Crimes by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic highlights the issues with grammar policing through humor, though it also sparks debate about literacy privilege and social inequality. Grammar nazis have even been found to be helpful to English learners.One aspect of grammar nazis that is often criticized is their insistence on grammatical \"purism.\" Grammar nazis strictly adhere to traditional grammar rules. However, their focus on minute details detracts from effective communication. These pedants fail to recognize the many dialects of English, such as African American English, as correct. This can exhibit racism or classism. They fail to acknowledge the difference between standard and linguistic grammar. Grammar nazis strictly adhere to etymological fallacy, and fail to recognize that words can have separate informal meanings.Many grammar pedants will rely on incorrect or outdated grammatical rules. Languages change over time, and formal grammar is not the only correct manner of speaking and writing. Conversational grammar is incredibly different. For example, a grammar nazi would be against using split infinitives, even though they are grammatically correct, and perfectly acceptable conversationally.Calling a grammar nazi a \"nazi\" is giving the word nazi a more lighthearted meaning in that context. Many argue that this is not an ethical practice, regarding the atrocities committed by the Nazis during WW2. Additionally, correcting people's grammar compulsively is oftentimes rude. These pedants can also be racist by not recognizing ethnic dialects.",
