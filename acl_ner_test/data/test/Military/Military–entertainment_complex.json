    "document": "The military:entertainment complex is the cooperation between militaries and entertainment industries to their mutual benefit, especially in such fields as cinema, multimedia, virtual reality, and multisensory extended reality.\nThough the term can be used to describe any military:entertainment complex in any nation, the most prominent complex is between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the film industry of the United States.\nDuring World War 2 the United States sought to use entertainment as a form of propaganda. In 1943 the Office of Strategic Services (a precursor to the CIA) circulated a memo stating the cinema is \"one of the most powerful propaganda weapons at the disposal of the United States\" and recommended \"the voluntary cooperation of all motion agencies not under the control of the JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff]\".The United States Office of War Information utilized cinema for its own ends to rally the public behind the war effort. Director Elmer Davis stated \"The easiest way to inject a propaganda idea into most people's minds is to let it go in through the medium of an entertainment picture when they do not realize that they are being propagandized\".\nIn 1953 US President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared \"The hand of government must be carefully concealed, and, in some cases I should say, wholly eliminated\" and that \"a great deal of this particular type of thing would be done through arrangements with all sorts of privately operated enterprises in the field of entertainment, dramatics, music, and so on and so on.\"\nFollowing the 9/11 attacks there was an increase in collaboration between the US government and Hollywood. In the weeks after the attack Karl Rove and a number of senior governmental officials travelled to Hollywood where they had a number of meetings with studio executives. The studios, including the President of the Motion Picture Association of America, pledged to aid the administration's efforts.\nIn Hollywood, many movie and television productions are, by choice, contractually supervised by the DoD Entertainment Media Unit within the Office of the Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon, and by the public affairs offices of the military services maintained solely for the American entertainment industry in Hollywood, Los Angeles . Producers looking to borrow military equipment or filming on location at a military installation for their works need to apply to the DoD, and submit their movies' scripts for vetting. Ultimately, the DoD has a say in every U.S.-made movie that uses DoD resources, not available on the open market, in their productions.During World War II, Hollywood \"became the unofficial propaganda arm of the U.S. military\".   The United States Office of War Information (OWI) had a unit exclusively dedicated to Hollywood called the Bureau of Motion Pictures. From 1942 to 1945, the OWI's Bureau of Motion Pictures reviewed 1,652 film scripts and revised or discarded any that portrayed the United States in a negative light, including material that made Americans seem \"oblivious to the war or anti-war.\" \nFour decades after the release of the 1954 adult animated film Animal Farm, Cold War historian Tony Shaw discovered, through looking at archives of the film, that the CIA had secretly purchased the rights to the film. The CIA also altered the ending of the film so that the pigs, who represent communists, were overthrown by the other animals on the farm.\nThe 1986 film Top Gun, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer at Paramount Pictures, and with DoD assistance, aimed at rebranding the U.S. Navy's image in the post-Vietnam War era. During the showings of the film, military recruiters set up tables in cinemas during its premieres. However, claims enlistments spiked as high as 500% are a myth, and enlistments only rose by approximately 8% in 1986. By the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, Hollywood producers were stressing script writers to create military-related plots to gain production power from the U.S. military.\n",
