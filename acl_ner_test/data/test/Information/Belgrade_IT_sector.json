The IT sector in Serbia is projected to become largest sector of the Serbian economy.\nMicrosoft, Huawei, and Kaspersky have opened development centers Belgrade. Microsoft Development Center Serbia was, at the time of its establishment, the fifth such center in the world. Other global IT companies that choose Belgrade for their regional or European center include Asus, Intel, Dell, Huawei, and NCR. These major investments generated over €678.3 million in Serbia's exports in 2015.\nNordeus, a local video game startup, is one of Europe's fastest-growing gaming companies. In five years of operation, Nordeus has grown to over 150 employees and €64 million of yearly sales.Another local startup, FishingBooker, was founded in 2013 and now employs over 90 people. FishingBooker has been described as \"the world’s largest online travel company that enables [users] to find and book fishing trips.\" Like Nordeus, FishingBooker, is a bootstrapped startup.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, more than US$65 million has been raised by Serbian startups including US$45 million for Seven Bridges (a Bioinformatics firm) and US$14 million for Vast (a data analysis firm). Also in 2016, a Belgrade-based website AskGamblers which generates over €810,000 in revenue and €620,000 in profits was sold to Catena Media for €15 million.\nThe startup community is supported by a non-profit organization called Startit which acts as an incubator for new companies. Startit raised US$108,000 from its Kickstarter campaign in 2015, allowing it to expand its Belgrade center, build a second center in Inđija (completed in February 2016), and expand further to other cities with strong IT industry: Novi Sad, Zrenjanin, Vršac, Subotica, Šabac. Other developments include an agriculture drone startup that uses drones for land surveying, TeleSkin an app which can identify and track skin cancer and there was another successful Kickstarter for Hexiwear a customizable smartwatch for developers.\n",
