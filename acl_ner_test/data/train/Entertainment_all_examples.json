        "doc": "Anvil firing (also known as anvil launching or anvil shooting) is the practice of firing an anvil into the air with gunpowder.\nIt is a traditional event held in New Westminster to celebrate Queen Victoria's birthday.\nIn the United Kingdom, the term refers to a method of testing anvils. Black powder was poured onto the top of the anvil and ignited. If the anvil did not shatter, it was deemed safe to use.\nTypically, two anvils are used: one as a base (placed upside down), and another one (also known as the \"flier\") as the projectile (placed right-side up, atop the base).An alternative method is to place the bottom anvil upright, and fill the hardy hole with black powder. A torus or washer, often made from a playing card, is placed over the hole, with a space for a fuse or powder trail. The top anvil is placed upside down, face to face with the bottom anvil.\nA technique for firing a single anvil uses a stone base. The space formed by the anvil's concave base is filled with black powder. Modern double-base powders have much higher energy densities, making them unsuitable. A fuse is made to project out, then lit, and the resulting deflagration sends the projectile anvil several feet into the air.\nAnvils were traditionally fired on St. Clement's Day, honoring Pope Clement I, the patron saint of blacksmiths and metalworkers.\nAlthough its practice has lessened in recent years, enthusiasts still participate in anvil launching events and competitions. On September 5, 2011, The Science Channel premiered Flying Anvils, a reality television series about anvil firing.\nIndividuals may be crushed by falling anvils. The black powder can also prematurely ignite when the top anvil is placed. As in any case where an explosive is confined on all sides by metal, shrapnel presents a hazard. If a damaged or structurally weak anvil is used, the anvil base may shatter upon ignition.The technique depends on the fact that black powder is a low explosive, which burns more rapidly when under pressure.A “21-anvil salute” replaced the traditional 21-gun salute on Victoria Day 1860 in New Westminster, British Columbia, after the town's cannon and status as capital of British Columbia was taken away.On November 7, 1864 during the American Civil War, the commander of the Iowa Home Guard militia in Davis County, Iowa, having no artillery piece at his disposal, ordered a local citizen to fire an anvil in the county seat at Bloomfield to alert militiamen in outlying townships in response to intelligence received of the presence of Confederate bushwhackers in Davis County. This was in response to a report of two suspected Confederate guerrillas at a residence in the neighborhood where they had demanded money and food and had terrorized the occupants, a Mr. and Mrs. Gore. The private citizen who carried out the order to fire the anvil was seriously injured.\nOne noteworthy celebration was held on the day the State of Texas voted to secede from the Union. On February 23, 1861, Texas Ranger and prominent Union supporter Thomas Lopton Campbell Jr. was held captive and forced to \"fire the anvils\" in the streets of Austin.\n",

        "doc": "The theatrical genre of aqua drama that was popular in 19th century France, England, and the United States involved flooding the arenas of circuses for recreations of major naval conflicts and similar aquatic events;  some venues participated to such a great extent in this once-popular form as to install permanent water-tanks on stage. Water-based spectacles, especially those portraying great naval battles, had been popular in Roman times, when they were known as naumachia, and the custom was resurrected at various times during the Middle Ages.\nAt the start of the 19th century, the already established Sadler's Wells Theatre came under the management of Charles Dibdin, Jr., a man who had big plans for the theatre's future. In 1804, he installed a large 90x24x3ft water tank that covered the entire stage. The water used to fill the tank was pumped in from the New River, which was adjacent to the theatre, by an Archimedes wheel. This process took twelve men twelve hours: four men would work in four hour shifts and then rotate until the entire tank was full. Even though the tanks were drained and refilled every three weeks they would become filthy. The water would become dirty not only from the shows, but the actors would bathe in the tank, along with rowdy audience members jumping in to see if the water was real. The Aquatic Drama was popular in the early 19th century, and with Sadler's Wells on the outskirts of London, the audiences, especially in the pit were unruly, loud, and most likely drunk. The large water tank that these disruptive audience members would jump into was not the only tank in the theatre, Dibdin Jr. had a second 5x5x5 ft tank above the theatre that was used to simulate waterfalls.The first show Dibdin, Jr. and his crew put on was The Siege of Gibraltar. It opened in 1804, and it was a play that depicted the naval battle between the English Navy and the Spanish Armada. A playbill from this performance describes the battle in the show:\"the conflagration of the town in various places, the defense of the garrison, and attack by the floating batteries, [which] is so faithfully and naturally represented, that when the floating batteries take fire, some blowing up with a dreadful explosion, and others, after burning to the water’s edge, sink to the bottom; while the gallant Sir Roger Curtis appears in his boat to save the drowning Spaniards, the British tars for that purpose plunging into the water, the effect is such as to produce an unprecedented climax of astonishment and applause.\"\nThere were 177 ships on the liquid stage, all equipped with live guns and ready for battle. Over a hundred real scale sized naval ships would not have been able to fit in Sadler's Wells tanks, so Dibdin hired men who worked at the Woolwich Dockyards to build him smaller ships built at a one-inch per foot scale, with exact detailed imitation down to the rigging. Children were cast as some of the Spanish naval officers manning the tiny ships, and were seen “drowning” after the Spanish had been defeated. The climactic battle of the show was when the English and Spanish went head on, full force, with guns blazing, and the audience members saw incredible spectacle as the English triumphantly destroyed the Spanish Armada.\nIn 1823 Sadler's Wells presented the aqua drama entitled The Island or Christian and His Comrades which dramatized the main events of the Mutiny on board HMS Bounty. In order to alleviate a twenty-minute delay between a dry land scene and an aquatic scene, the stage was made to ascend to near the roof of the theatre, in full view of the audience.\nEventually the aqua drama slash began to ripple then calm as audience members were no longer pleased with what was being performed at Sadler's Wells. This could have been due to the fact that Dibdin, Jr. tried to reuse many of his 177 ships from the Siege of Gibraltar, and they were no longer new and exciting to the audiences, but also the Napoleonic wars could have contributed. According to Dan Cuickshank at BBC News, the Napoleonic wars were raging on during the early 1800s and England dipped its toes in the war waters in 1793 with the new Revolutionary France. After a decade of fighting the two countries finally signed at the Treaty of Amiens, which only lasted a month until in May 1803 war broke out between the two countries again. The initial declaration of war could have sparked a rise in nationalism with in England, being a contributing factor into the Dibden, Jr. and his aquatic drama's success. Britain was known for having a large and powerful navy, and they didn't mind flexing their muscles as they asserted themselves as the most powerful navy in Europe at the 1815 after their victory at Waterloo. The citizens of England would have known how powerful their countries navy was. Seeing shows, such as the ones being put at Sadler's Wells, reminded the English people of how strong their military was, making them feel proud and safe initially. Yet, after a few years into the war the citizens began to realize the horrors of war. According to Mather, they were exposed not only to the death of friends and family along with the fear of invasion, but also the raising of taxes to fund the military. A staggering 11.6 million, which is around 570 million pounds in today's market, was spent on forts alone, most of which were protecting dock yards. The British people became fed up with war, especially naval combat and eventually the tanks were taken out of the theatre. Removal of the tanks due to lack of popularity reflects the English nation's view of war.Even though the tanks were removed in 1824, aqua drama was a part of a long lasting theatre's history. The legacy left behind of aquatic theatre is only a few pages in books and websites, and a painting or two, but Sadler's Wells legacy has been alive and well since Richard Sadler first opened his music house in 1683. Since then the theatre has seen many triumphs and tragedies. After Charles Dibdin, Jr. resigned there was a false fire alarm during one of the shows which lead to 18 people being stampeded to death.In 1843 the theater was once again successful, as the actor manager Samuel Philips put on Shakespeare's plays. Sadly, in 1915 the doors to Sadler's Wells were closed. Lilian Baylis, who wanted everyone in London to have the privilege to see the mesmerizing art of theatre, raised the money to reopen Sadler's Wells. The Sadler's Wells legacy continued as it was once again able to share theatre's magic with the people of northern London in 1931. After many years of putting on progressive theatre that entertained northern London, the play aspect of Sadler's Wells eventually faded out, opera and dance became prominent. Around 1945 Sadler's Wells started to become a strictly dance performance hall. The theatre legacy was replaced over the next half century as the once music hall become an outstanding, well respected dance hall. Sadler's Wells still stands today, not in the same building, but with the murky water of Charles Dibdin, Jr.’s aquatic theatre running in its historic veins.\n",

        "doc": "The Delfines Hotel & Convention Center, formerly known as the Delfines Hotel & Casino and commonly known as the Hotel Los Delfines, is a five-star hotel in San Isidro District, Lima, Peru. From its opening in 1997 until 2010, the hotel was best known for its two bottlenose dolphins, Yaku and Wayra, who gave the hotel its name.\nThe hotel, owned by Jacques Levy Calvo—a Peruvian businessman and banker of French-Jewish descent—and his siblings, opened on July 15, 1997, intended to attract foreign businessmen visiting the city. Its name came from the two dolphins that were trained by Levy's (then) wife, María Elena Llanos. At the time of its opening, it was the first hotel able to host more than 1,000 in an event hall.In 2008, the hotel's \"Salón Mediterráneo\" event hall was one of the locations where meetings of that year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation were held.\nYaku (born c. 1988) and Wayra (born c. 1992) are two male and female bottlenose dolphins that served as the hotel's namesake and main attraction from 1997 to 2010. Born off the coasts of Cuba, they were smuggled to Mexico, where they became known as \"Yoyo\" and \"Laly\" until their arrival to Peru, where they were moved to the hotel and renamed to the Quechua words for \"water\" and \"air\", respectively.The dolphins' arrival to Peru in 1997 after their purchase the year before led to an immediate response by animal welfare groups in the country, with the Judiciary of Peru ruling in favour of the hotel, concluding that the pool where they were kept was built prior to the creation of any regulations regarding the maintenance of captive dolphins. Consequently, the dolphins remained in the hotel, accessible to its guests and reportedly exposed to the show lights and street noise.\nIn 2010, both dolphins were moved from the hotel to another pool in a hill near La Herradura, a beach in Chorrillos District. The new site's poor conditions were condemned by local media, with its small size (12 m in diameter and 3.5 m deep) being highlighted. All visits ceased to be allowed in 2011.\nDuring the entirety of her captivity, Wayra became pregnant four times with ultimately no calf surviving due to the conditions they lived in. The one calf she gave birth to is alleged to have been crushed by her due to the small size of the hotel pool.\nBoth dolphins were reportedly moved to Dolphin Cove Jamaica, a dolphinarium in Jamaica, on July 18, 2014. These claims have since been disputed, however, by former caretaker Ursula Behr, who was once denied a visit to the dolphins in June 2014. María Elena Llanos, Levy's ex-wife, also denounced the lack of transparency and possible abuse in the animals' transport, highlighting that Yaku's cardiac issues could be fatal if not treated properly.\n",

        "doc": "Dumb Ways to Die is an Australian public awareness campaign video and media franchise made by Metro Trains in Melbourne, Victoria to promote railway safety. The original cartoon public service announcement for the awareness campaign went viral on social media after it was released on the internet in November 2012, amassing over 320 million views on YouTube. The campaign's animation was later developed into an mobile app available to iOS and Android devices.  \nOn 1 October 2021, PlaySide Studios acquired the Dumb Ways to Die franchise for A$2.25 million from Metro. PlaySide Studios also released an NFT called BEANS on 3 February 2022.\nThe campaign was devised by advertising agency McCann Melbourne. It appeared in newspapers, local radio and outdoor advertising throughout the Metro Trains network and on Tumblr. John Mescall, executive creative director of McCann, said \"The aim of this campaign is to engage an audience that really doesn't want to hear any kind of safety message, and we think dumb ways to die will.\" McCann estimated that within two weeks, it had generated at least $50 million worth of global media value in addition to more than 700 media stories, for \"a fraction of the cost of one TV ad\". According to Metro Trains, the campaign contributed to a 20% reduction in \"near-miss\" accidents compared to the annual average, or 30% with respect to the same time of the year before from 13.29 near-misses per million kilometres in November 2011 : January 2012, to 9.17 near-misses per million kilometres in November 2012 : January 2013.The video was art directed by Patrick Baron, animated by Julian Frost and produced by Cinnamon Darvall. It was uploaded to YouTube on 14 November 2012 and made public two days later. It featured characters known as \"Beans\", each bearing names such as \"Numpty,\" \"Hapless,\" \"Pillock,\" and \"Dippy\" (the first four beans in the video, listed in order of appearance) dying as a result of their own stupidity (doing such unwise things as setting their own hair on fire or provoking a grizzly bear); the final three beans shown in the video, named \"Stumble\", \"Bonehead\", and \"Putz\", all die as a result of unsafe behavior at train stations and/or railways, which are deemed \"the dumbest ways to die\". The animated video has two versions, one in English, and one in Spanish, titled \"Formas Tontas de Morir.\"\nThe song \"Dumb Ways to Die\" from the video was written by John Mescall and co created with Patrick Baron, music by Ollie McGill from the Cat Empire, who also produced it. It was performed by Emily Lubitz, the lead vocalist of Tinpan Orange, with McGill providing backing vocals. The band on the recording consists of Gavin Pearce on bass, Danny Farrugia on drums and Brett Wood on guitar. It was released on iTunes, attributed to the artist \"Tangerine Kitty\" (a reference to Tinpan Orange and The Cat Empire).The song, with a tempo of 128 beats per minute, is written in C major and a time signature of 4/4.\nCharts\nOn 6 May 2013, Metro released a Dumb Ways to Die game as an app for iOS devices. The game, developed by Julian Frost, Patrick Baron and Samuel Baird, invites players to avoid the dangerous activities engaged in by the various characters featured throughout the campaign. Within the app, players can also pledge to \"not do dumb stuff around trains.\" The activities include things like getting toast out with a fork and poking a stick at a grizzly bear.An Android version was released in September 2014. \nThe game is similar to games in the WarioWare series. The game presents minigames based on the animated music video in rapid succession and becomes faster and more difficult the longer the game is played.\nA sequel titled Dumb Ways to Die 2: The Games was released on 18 November 2014. In the sequel, there are a lot more varieties of challenges in each particular building, and each building has a particular theme. Before a train arrives at a building, the player plays a challenge to counter something related to trains. If successful, bonus points can be earned at the end of the game. There are 8 challenges each in every building. Like the original game, the game's characters do plenty of dangerous and unsafe activities. Lives can be lost by \"dying\" in one of the activities. The player has three chances to prevent the characters from dying.\nThe game is recently also available as a web and mobile-web version by MarketJS, license holder of the HTML5 web IP.\nA second sequel titled Dumb Ways to Die 3: World Tour was released on 21 December 2017. Unlike the previous games which both involved the player playing minigames and trying to prevent the characters from dying, here the player collects coins from houses that are fixed up from being initially broken. The houses are fixed by the player playing a new minigame for each area containing those houses.\nA third sequel titled Dumb Ways to Die 4 was released on Android and iOS on May 2, 2023.\nA spinoff was also released, titled Dumb Ways to Draw on 5 May 2019. In the game, the player has to draw lines with in-game pens to guide the characters to their goals. But they also have to prevent the characters' deaths by dangers. It also had a colouring section to colour and share drawings as well as a \"trace the picture\" section, in which the player is required to hold the screen until a line of sufficient length is drawn to trace the given diagram. The sequel titled Dumb Ways to Draw 2 was released on 23 December 2022.\nAnother spinoff, titled Dumb Ways to Dash was released on 13 December 2019. The player has to guide their character in a 3D race against other characters to the finish line while avoiding the obstacles.\nA third spinoff, titled Dumb Ways to Die: Superheroes was released on 25 June 2020. It has similar gameplay to the previous spinoff.\nThe Metro Trains has also published a number of other videos on its YouTube channel, \"Dumb Ways to Die\", including trailers of the games, a video centered on the MIFF, a series of Christmas-themed short videos, Halloween-themed videos, clips of the characters appearing in real life, and some other videos centered on Train Safety.Susie O'Brien in the Herald Sun in Melbourne criticised the ad for trivialising serious injuries and being about advertisers' ego rather than effective safety messages.Simon Crerar of the Herald Sun wrote that the song's \"catchy chorus was the most arresting hook since PSY's Gangnam Style.\" Alice Clarke writing in the Herald Sun described the video as \"adorably morbid\" and wrote that Victoria's public transport \"broke its long running streak of terrible ads\".\nDaisy Dumas of the Sydney Morning Herald described it as \"darkly cute—and irksomely catchy\" and the chorus as \"instant earworm material\".\nMichelle Starr of CNET described the campaign as the Darwin Awards meets The Gashlycrumb Tinies and the song as \"a cutesy indie-pop hit in the style of Feist\".\nLogan Booker of Gizmodo described it as \"taking a page out of the Happy Tree Friends book and mixing cute with horrifying\".\nKaren Stocks of YouTube Australia said the video was unusual due to the high number of views from mobile devices. Stocks attributed the success to \"A snappy headline. A catchy tune that gets stuck in your head. And a message that is easy to understand and perfectly targeted.\"\nThe Sunshine Coast Daily described it as \"the Gangnam Style of train safety campaigns\".\nArlene Paredes of the International Business Times said the video was \"brilliant in getting viewers' attention\" and \"arguably one of the cutest PSAs ever made.\"\nThe campaign received some criticism on the basis that suicide is one of the most influential causes of rail trauma, and the ad reinforces deadly trains as a possible suicide method. Writing in Mumbrella in February 2013, a former employee of Victoria's Department of Infrastructure advised critical thinking when evaluating claims made regarding improvements to safety. Reference was made specifically to the claimed 20 per cent reduction in risky behaviour as being \"social media bullshit\".In February 2013, Artemy Lebedev's blog was censored by Roskomnadzor, the Russian government agency in charge of Internet censorship, for including the video. Later that day, the YouTube video was also censored, with the \"This content is not available in your country due to a legal complaint from the government\" message. The official takedown notice sent to Livejournal.com was quoted, in part, by Lebedev in his blog.The song's lyrics contains a description of different ways of committing suicide, such as: using drugs beyond their expiration date, standing on an edge of a platform, running across the rails, eating superglue and other. The animated personages demonstrate dangerous ways of suicide in attractive for children and teenagers comic format. The lines such as \"Use a clothes dryer as a hiding place\" and \"I wonder what's this red button do?\" contain an incitement to commit those acts.\nDespite this, the video was still included into the ABC Show and was shown in more than 50 cities across Russia.\nThe campaign won seven Webby Awards in 2013 including the Best Animation Film & Video and Best Public Service & Activism (Social Content & Marketing).It won three Siren Awards, run by Commercial Radio Australia, including the Gold Siren for best advertisement of the year and Silver Sirens for the best song and best campaign.\nThe public service announcement was awarded the Grand Trophy in the 2013 New York Festivals International Advertising Awards.\nIn June 2013, the campaign clip won the Integrated Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and overall, won five Grand Prix awards, 18 Gold Lions, three Silver Lions, and two Bronze Lions, which was the most for any campaign in the festival's history.\n",

        "doc": "Elegiac comedy was a genre of medieval Latin literature—or drama—represented by about twenty texts written in the 12th and 13th centuries in the liberal arts schools of west central France (roughly the Loire Valley). Though commonly identified in manuscripts as comoedia, modern scholars often reject their status as comedy. Unlike Classical comedy, they were written in elegiac couplets. Denying their true comedic nature, Edmond Faral called them Latin fabliaux, after the later Old French fabliaux, and Ian Thomson labelled them Latin comic tales. Other scholars have invented terms like verse tales, rhymed monologues, epic comedies, and Horatian comedies to describe them. The Latin \"comedies\", the dramatic nature of which varies greatly, may have been the direct ancestors of the fabliaux but more likely merely share similarities. Other interpretations have concluded that they are primitive romances, student juvenilia, didactic poems, or merely collections of elegies on related themes.\nSome elegiac comedies were adapted into vernacular language in the later Middle Ages, and retold by major vernacular writers such as Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Gower. The poem Pamphilus has Venetian and Old French versions.\nThese comedies were composed in a high style, but they were typically about low or unimportant subject matter; lyric complaints only sometimes mixed with amorous content. They combined the plot and character types of the Greek \"new comedy\" practised by Terence and Plautus, but the greatest influence on them was Ovid. His Ars amatoria, Amores, and Heroides were highly influential. Plautus, though less widely read in the Middle Ages, was also an influence, as were the Scholastic debates concerning the nature of universals and other contemporary philosophical problems, with which the elegiac comedies often dealt, always humorously but no doubt sometimes to a serious end.The elegiac dramatists delight in \"showing off\" their Latin skills. Their use of rhetoric, logic, and various grammatical constructions suggest that they may have been used in the schools as exercises in poetic composition and philosophical argument. The language of their \"fools\" can be deliberately outlandish, and their deft use of puns is frequently sexual in nature. Parody is another typical element of elegiac humour. Persons of low rank are often placed in positions unsuited to them. Their bumbling, as when a rustic attempts to speak philosophically or the commoner pretends he is a chivalrous gentleman, is portrayed for its satiric effect. Satire is often employed in long digressions criticizing the corruption of the times, specifically targeting the selling of church offices, political corruption at court, sycophants’ attempts to rise in society, and aristocrats’ attempts to philosophize. In the Middle Ages, satire was usually considered a breed of comedy.\nThe comedies were often about a sexual conquest, in which the lover must use his guile to overcome obstacles such as guardians, rivals, and reluctance on the part of the woman. The setting is some unspecified time contemporary with the poet, and the characters are all typical and have names descriptive of their traits and function in the story. The lack of resources on the part of the hero forces him to resort to deception and to employ intermediaries (as Ovid did in his narratives) in order to win the object of his desire.The elegiac comedies bear limited dramatic features. Thompson denies their theatricality, saying that \"no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs.\" A similar opinion is that the comedies are rhetorical exercises. Medieval poetic theory, however, did not regard comedy and elegy as mutually exclusive, nor identical. John of Garland wrote \"all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true.\" Other arguments raised against the dramatic performance of the comedies is, in general, their large number of narrative segments as opposed to dialogue. Arnulf of Orléans, one of the elegiac writers, seems to have considered his work to have been made for the stage. These performances may have been narrated, mimed, or sung.\n",

        "title": "Metagame",
        "doc": "A metagame, broadly defined as \"a game beyond the game\", typically refers to either of two concepts: a game which revolves around a core game; or the strategies and approaches to playing a game. A metagame can serve a broad range of purposes, and may be tied to the way a game relates to various aspects of life.  \nIn competitive games, the metagame can refer to the most popular strategy, often called a game's meta, or preparation for a match in general. \nIn tabletop role-playing game, metagaming has been used to describe players discussing the game, sometimes simply rules discussions and other times causing the characters they control to act in ways they normally would not within the story.\nThe word metagame is composed of the Greek-derived prefix meta: (from μετά, meta, meaning \"beyond\") and the noun game. The shorthand meta has been backronymed as \"Most Effective Tactics Available\" to tersely explain the concept. Metagame was used in the context of playing zero-sum games in a publication by the Mental Health Research Institute in 1956. It is alternately claimed that the first known use of the term was in Nigel Howard's book Paradoxes of Rationality: Theory of Metagames and Political Behavior published in 1971, where Howard used the term in his analysis of the Cold War political landscape using a variation of the Prisoner's Dilemma.,  however Howard used the term in Metagame Analysis in Political Problems published in 1966. In 1967, the word appeared in a study by Russell Lincoln Ackoff and in the Bulletin of the Operations Research Society of America.In casual gaming, the metagame generally refers to any meaningful interaction between players and elements not directly part of the game. The concept gained traction in game design in a column written in 1995 by Richard Garfield, the creator of Magic: The Gathering, for The Duelist. In a 2000 talk at the Game Developers Conference, Garfield expanded on this, defining metagame as \"how a game interfaces beyond itself\", and asserted that this can include \"what you bring to a game, what you take away from a game, what happens between games, [and] what happens during a game\".  Stephanie Boluk and Patrick Lemieux extend and refine Garfield's term to apply to potentially all forms of play and gaming, arguing that metagames are often more important than video games themselves.  They go on to describe that metagaming \"results from the entanglement of philosophical concepts, the craft of game design, and the cultures of play that surrounds videogames.\"In the world of competitive games, rule imprecisions and non-goal oriented play are not commonplace. As a result, the extent of metagaming narrows down mostly to studying strategies of top players and exploiting commonly-used strategies for an advantage. Those may evolve as updates are released or new, better, strategies are discovered by top players. The opposite metagame of playing a relatively unknown strategy for surprisal is often called off-meta.This usage is particularly common in games that have large, organized play systems or tournament circuits. Some examples of this kind of environment are tournament scenes for tabletop or computer collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering, Gwent: The Witcher Card Game or Hearthstone, tabletop war-gaming such as Warhammer 40,000 and Flames of War, or team-based multiplayer online games such as Star Conflict, Dota 2, League of Legends, and Team Fortress 2. In some games, such as Heroes of the Storm, each battleground has a different metagame.\nThe meta in these environments is often affected by new elements added by the game's developers and publishers, such as new card expansions in card games, or adjustments to character abilities in online games. The metagame may also come within player communities as reactions to win over currently-popular strategies, creating ebbs and flows of strategy types over time.\nIn competitive games, more pervasive forms of metagaming like teaming in free-for-all multiplayer games can be interpreted as cheating or as bad sportsmanship. Writer Richard Garfield's book, Lost in the Shuffle: Games Within Games, considers instead teaming as just a form of metagaming. The practice of losing individual games to dodge stronger opponents in tournaments has also been interpreted as a form of metagaming, sometimes considered as unfair.Exploiting the meta is commonplace in esports. In StarCraft, a player's previous matches with the same opponent have given them insight into that player's play style and may cause them to make certain decisions which would otherwise seem inferior. Another instance of using the meta in esports was in 2012 at The International, a Dota 2 competition, when one team was able to exploit \"predictable, economical strategies and that summer's metagame, the in-game decisions and team configurations that were fashionable\" to counter a play by the other team. In fighting games, the meta is also played through character selection. The opposing character has various strengths that can be avoided and weaknesses that can be exploited more easily depending on the character you choose provided you are aware of those strengths and weaknesses (called a \"match up\"). For a basic example, a character with a projectile attack has the advantage over a grappler who must be close to the opponent to be effective. Match up metagaming is very important in tournament settings. In recent fighting games, blind select has been implemented for online modes. This makes it so that neither player can see what character the other player chose. In tournaments, players have the option to opt for a blind select where they tell a judge in confidence the character they intend to select in the match, making their character choice mandatory. A newer trend in more recently released titles is to allow the selection of multiple characters at once which the player can then switch between on the fly, rendering match-up picking excessively hard and virtually impractical.\nIn popular trading card games, such as Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon Trading Card Game, or Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game players compete with decks they have created in advance and the meta consists of the deck types that are currently popular and expected to show up in large numbers in a tournament. The knowledge of metagame trends can give players an edge against other participants, both while they are playing by quickly recognizing what kind of deck opponents have and guessing their likely cards or moves, and during the deck building process, by selecting cards that do well against current popular deck types at the possible expense of performance against rarer ones. Another example of metagaming would be bluffing opponents into expecting cards that you do not have, or surprising the competition with novel decks that they may not be prepared for. The secondary market of cards is heavily influenced by metagame trends: cards become more valuable when they are popular, often to the point of scarcity.Competitive chess has a well-defined meta in the form of chess openings and chess schools. A particular example are hypermodern openings. They became popular after World War I as high-ranked players like Aron Nimzowitsch started to play them. A popular off-meta is to play unpopular openings for humor or for strategically denying subsequent use of opening theory.\nMore narrowly, the playing history (meta) of a player or small group of players can be used to gain an advantage. A scholar's mate is a special set of moves can allow a player to win in four moves, usually by and against beginners. An example where this meta can be exploited by the opponent is as follows: competitor A has been watching Competitor B play chess, and the past five games in a row Competitor B has attempted to use this four-move win.  When Competitor A sits down to play against Competitor B, Competitor A can play in a way to give them an advantage, assuming Competitor B repeats this line.\nIn tabletop role-playing games, metagaming can refer to aspects of play that occur outside of a given game's fictional universe. In particular, metagaming often refers to having an in-game character act on knowledge that the player has access to, but the character should not.  For example, having a character bring a mirror to defeat Medusa when they are unaware her gaze can petrify them, or being more cautious when the game is run by a merciless gamemaster.Some consider metagaming to benefit oneself bad sportsmanship. It is frowned upon in many role-playing communities, as it upsets suspension of disbelief, and affects game balance. However, some narrativist indie role-playing games deliberately support metagaming and encourage shared storytelling among players.\nThe metagame for game developers refers to the extra set of rules and logic that are independent of the core gameplay. This can involve extra progressions or an economic market appended to the core gameplay that add mid- and long-term goals for players. Some researchers argue that having a metagame for players can increase user engagement with those games.",

        "doc": "Musical canine freestyle, also known as musical freestyle, freestyle dance, and canine freestyle, is a modern dog sport that is a mixture of obedience training, tricks, and dance that allows for creative interaction between dogs and their owners. The sport has developed into competition forms in several countries around the world.\nMusical freestyle started in many places almost simultaneously around 1989, with demonstrations of the talent of heeling to music being shown in Canada, England, the United States, and the Netherlands within three years of each other. The main unifying element among the groups was an interest in more creative obedience demonstrations and dog training, a love of music, and, in many cases, inspiration from an equine sport called musical kur, which was a more creative and dynamic form of dressage.The first official musical freestyle group, Musical Canine Sports International, was founded in British Columbia, Canada, in 1991. Soon, other groups followed in the United States and England. Each region began developing its own style, with many American groups promoting more trick-based routines and costumes. English groups focused more on heel work and on the dog, and less on costumes and design. Musical freestyle has become more common in animal talent shows and specialty acts.\nTeaching a dog to be able to work on both sides of the handler's body, not just the left side as in standard obedience heeling, is the first step to doing freestyle. The trainer first breaks the routine into pieces with only two or three moves linked together, and as they progress these pieces are linked together.There are two types of musical canine freestyle, freestyle heeling (also known as heelwork to music) and musical freestyle.\nHeelwork to music focuses on a dog's ability to stay in variations of the heel position while the handler moves to music. In heel work to music, the dog and trainer remain close to each other at all times. Sending the dog away or doing distance work is not part of the routine, with the dog remaining almost invisibly tethered to the trainer. Pivots, and moving diagonally, backwards, and forwards to a suitable musical theme are important to the routine. Jumping, weaving, rolling, passing through the trainer's legs and anything else considered \"not heeling\" is not allowed.Musical freestyle demands that the dog perform a variety of tricks and other obedience talents. In musical freestyle, heel work can be combined with other moves such as leg weaving, sending the dog away, moving together at a distance, and more dramatic tricks such as jumping, spinning, bowing, rolling over. Dancing in place, and other innovative actions where the dog plays off the dance moves of the trainer are encouraged. A popular finishing trick for some routines is for the dog to jump into the trainer's arms, or over his or her back.Currently, there are several organizations regulating competitive freestyle, such as Rally Freestyle Elements, the World Canine Freestyle Organization, Canine Freestyle Federation, Dogs Can Dance and the Musical Dog Sport Association in the United States, Paws 2 Dance Canine Freestyle Organization in Canada, Canine Freestyle GB in Great Britain, and Pawfect K9 Freestyle Club in Japan. In the UK, the sport is called Heelwork to Music and is an officially recognized sport of the Kennel club.Competition rules vary from group to group, and from country to country, but most are based on a variety of technical and artistic merit points. All routines are done free of training aids or leashes, except in some beginner categories. Competition can be done as a single dog-and-handler team, as a pair of dogs and handlers, or as a full team of three or more dogs and their handlers. Generally, there is only one dog per handler for competition.\nIn either type of competition, the choice of music and the way the routine reflects the music is important. Routines not following the rhythm, no matter how well executed, do not score well.\nExhibition freestyle is a no-holds-barred routine designed to demonstrate the full extent of creativity and excitement that musical freestyle can offer. Though highly entertaining and representing what most people see on television or at events, it allows for moves, props, cues, and costumes that would not usually be allowed on the competition circuit.\nRally Freestyle Elements (Rally FrEE) combines the trick behaviors of Canine Musical Freestyle with the format of Rally-Obedience.\n",

        "doc": "Nonchalance began as an art collective in Oakland, California around 2002, and later in 2008 was transformed into a design consultancy group. Their work focuses on interactive, immersive art installations, which they call \"situational design\".\nNonchalance was launched by Jeff Hull around 2002. Their first project was the street art campaign called Oaklandish. Original projects included a wheat-paste poster series, the \"Oakland-Love Retrospective\" slide show (projected onto downtown architectural landmarks), the Liberation Drive-In parking lot movie series, and the Oakslander Lakeside Gazette zine. These projects aimed to infuse cultural content into negative urban spaces during a time of rapid development in the city.In 2008, Nonchalance created The Jejune Institute, an alternate reality game, public art installation and immersive experience that ran in San Francisco, California, from 2008 to 10 April 2011. The Jejune Institute featured a narrative that made use of live actors, puzzles, phone calls, radio transmissions, staged protests, and interactive promenade theater. It centered on characters such as the eponymous Jejune Institute and its founder, the rebel group the Elsewhere Public Works Agency, and a rebellious young woman named Eva.Over the course of three years, it enrolled more than 10,000 players who, responding to eccentric flyers plastered all over the city, started the game by receiving their \"induction\" at the fake headquarters of the institute, located in an office building in San Francisco's Financial District.\nIn 2015, Nonchalance opened the Latitude Society, an invite-only secret society and immersive experience. It featured a clubhouse, an arcade, and regular social events. The Latitude Society closed after one year, at least partially due to an operating cost of $3,000 per day.From 2021 to 2022, Nonchalance ran a podcast called SYGNYL, \"a participatory-arts podcast\" inviting the audience to participate in \"small collaborative acts in the real world.\"The Jejune Institute won \"Best World\" and \"Best Story\" at Indiecade 2010, and \"Best Alternate Reality\" in the SF Bay Guardian's \"Best of the Bay 2010\".",

        "doc": "Rene Peter Onno Rubiono van Helsdingen (born 25 February 1957) is a Dutch pianist and composer.\nHe studied classical music with Komter Loeber in Blaricum in the Netherlands from 1962:72. Then he studied jazz music with Terry Trotter and Lazlo Cser in Los Angeles in 1979. His earliest influences include Oscar Peterson, McCoy Tyner and Bill Evans.\nOver the years pianist René has recorded and produced for many different labels, such as Virgin, Timeless, WEA, Dureco,  Zebra Acoustic, Pacific Music, Turning Point records, Munich Records, demajors Independent Music Industry Jakarta and his own labels: Relukreul records, and Helsdingen Music, The Netherlands. Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper The Age characterised him as \"A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity. René allows himself a few extended workouts and avoids the trap of repeating himself or overstating his case.\"\nHelsdingen has organized many successful tours, projects and festivals sponsored by NGOs, governmental institutions, companies to which he was responsible with regard to the control over the budgets made available.\n",

        "title": "Rule_63",
        "doc": "Rule 63 is an Internet meme that states that, as a rule, \"for every character there is a gender swapped version of that character\". It is one of the \"Rules of the Internet\" that began in 2006 as a Netiquette guide on 4chan and were eventually expanded upon by including deliberately mocking rules, of which Rule 63 is an example. It began to see general use in fandom communities as a term to refer to both fan-made and official gender flips of existing fictional characters.\nPrior to the creation of Rule 63, gender flipping was popularized in video games in the 1990s by the finishing move of Darkstalkers character Demitri Maximoff, a vampire. Called the \"Midnight Bliss\", it involved tossing a rose at a character to transform them into a helpless maiden and completely drain them of life energy. This meant that female versions of all the game's male characters had to be created, as well as those of Street Fighter and SNK characters when SNK vs. Capcom included Maximoff. These female interpretations became popular and resulted in large amounts of fan art, as well as prompting art of gender-swaps of other male and female characters.Rule 63 was created in mid-2007 as an addition to the humorous \"Rules of the Internet\", originally created around the end of 2006 on 4chan. It lists two statements:\n\"for every given male character, there is a female version of that character\", and\n\"for every given female character, there is a male version of that character\".\nThe trope, originally seen primarily unofficially, later became more widely disseminated in popular culture, with critics stating that it had been \"recognized by Hollywood\".\nRule 63 is commonly used as a term to refer to gender-swapped interpretations of existing characters in fanworks, such as fan art, fan fiction and cosplay, and it is particularly pervasive in the anime and manga community, where communities sprang up built around romantic gender-swap relationships. It also often overlaps with the creation of moe anthropomorphic female versions of non-human, male characters. A well-known example of this is Bowsette, a female version of the Mario antagonist Bowser that became one of the most popular Internet memes of 2018. However, it has also been used by critics to refer to official characters who are gender-swapped versions of older characters or fictional beings, such as Number Six from Battlestar Galactica being a \"sexy female\" version of a Cylon Centurion, and the female main cast of the 2016 reboot of Ghostbusters.The creation of Rule 63 cosplays such as gender-swapped superheroes has been cited as popular among female cosplayers as giving them the ability to portray roles beyond socially approved gendered scripts. It is seen as empowering, allowing cosplayers to wear clothing and weapons usually not afforded to female characters. However, certain characters with inherent gender fluidity are said to work better than others. Such gender-bending cosplay, which allows the cosplayer to choose what behavior enhances the performance, can be contrasted with crossplay, which completely immerses the cosplayer in the codes of another gender.\nAdventure Time received a spin-off series entitled Fionna and Cake, based on the eponymous episode of the original show, which featured Fionna and Cake, gender-swapped versions of Finn and Jake as main characters, as well as genderbent versions of other characters that later featured in other episodes.The 2016 Ghostbusters reboot featured a cast of female leads that was called \"proof of Rule 63\", with similarities noted between each team member and one of the original male team members. It was called an official acknowledgement of what was formerly an unofficial, fan-driven phenomenon.\nIn an episode of The Loud House titled One of the Boys, Lincoln has a dream of traveling to an alternate dimension where all his sisters are male. Near the end of the episode, he travels to another dimension where he is female. A picture of him and a female version of Clyde, his best friend, can be seen in \"her\" room.\nIn an episode of Malcolm in the Middle, season 4, episode 10, titled \"If Boys Were Girls\", Lois pictures Reese, Malcolm, and Dewey as girls, named Renee, Mallory, and Daisy, respectively. Francis is also a girl named Frances, with Christopher Kennedy Masterson in drag.\nIn the Mario series, the fan-made Bowsette is a female version of the male antagonist Bowser, created through the use of the Super Crown, a power-up that imparts the appearance and abilities of Princess Peach on its user. Nintendo's official clarification is that the item is only usable by Toadette, and the creation of Bowsette is \"technically impossible\".In Shovel Knight, a \"Body Swap Mode\" (originally called \"Gender Swap\") was added after it was funded as a Kickstarter goal, allowing the player to change the secondary sex characteristics of every major character in the game (and, independently, their pronouns) via the settings menu. The developers endeavored to maintain parity with the original character designs by only making their swapped version as gendered as the original, as well as matching their existing personality and gameplay.\nIn the Zelda series, the character Linkle was created by Nintendo as an alternate-universe gender-swap of the typical main character, Link. However, she does not possess his powers, and is instead a normal girl who dual-wields a pair of crossbows. Made playable in Hyrule Warriors Legends, she was also modded into The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild by a fan to replace Link. The character Sheik, who Princess Zelda has the ability to transform into in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, has been called the most iconic example of female-to-male gender-swapping in gaming, although Sheik has both male and female characteristics.\n",

        "doc": "Varsity Spirit, LLC, also known as Varsity, is an American cheerleading company owned by Varsity Brands. Founded in 1974 as the Universal Cheerleaders Association, the company is a manufacturer of apparel for cheerleading and dance teams, organizer of cheerleading competitions, and operator of training camps and sanctioning bodies. \nThe company's vertical integration of competitive cheerleading has faced criticism, including accusations of anti-competitive and monopolistic practices (including opposition to cheerleading being sanctioned as a sport), conflicts of interest via control of governing bodies, and institutionalizing high financial costs for participation in competitive cheerleading. In 2023 and 2024, Varsity and its previous owners agreed to settle multiple class action lawsuits, including those surrounding high financial costs, and conflicts of interest with the U.S. All Star Federation.\nVarsity Spirit was founded by Jeff Webb, a yell leader at the University of Oklahoma contemplating law school. After working as a summer camp instructor for Lawrence \"Herkie\" Herkimer's National Cheerleaders Association (NCA), he attempted, but failed, to acquire part of the company.In 1974, Webb established the Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA), in an effort to raise the profile of cheerleading, initially by establishing training camps, and later through promotional campaigns and its National College Cheerleading Championship (which was first held in 1978) and its National High School Cheerleading Championship (which was first held in 1980). Cheerleading had seen declines in participation due to the growth of women's sports following the introduction of Title IX. \nWebb first operated the company out of his apartment, and only made a profit of US$850 (equivalent to $5,251 in 2023) during his first year of operations. By 2002, Webb estimated that Varsity Spirit held about half of the market, and that 60% of its revenue came from apparel. In 2003, Varsity backed the formation of the U.S. All Star Federation, a sanctioning body for \"all-star\" cheerleading competitions involving teams from private gyms. \nIn 2004, Varsity acquired National Spirit Group, owner of the NCA (which Webb estimated to have a 25% market share in 2002), giving it control of the sheer majority of the cheerleading industry. In 2005, it acquired the Knoxville-based Athletic Championships LLC and Premier Athletics LLC. In 2007, it backed the formation of USA Cheer, a non-profit led by Webb which aimed to be a sanctioning body for cheerleading (with a goal to back cheerleading as a proposed Olympic event).\nIn 2011, Varsity Brands merged with Herff Jones, an Indianapolis-based manufacturer of class rings, caps and gowns, and yearbooks; Webb was named president and COO in December 2012, and the merged company took on the Varsity Brands name in 2014. In 2012, it acquired American Cheerleader magazine from Macfadden Communications Group, with the publishers of Memphis-based teen magazine Justine producing the magazine. Charlesbank Capital Partners acquired Varsity Brands in 2014, after which it began to place a larger focus on club-based \"all-star\" cheerleading. In 2015, it acquired JAM Brands, which had been the company's main competitor in the 2010s.\nIn 2016, Varsity Brands sued Star Athletica, a competing manufacturer of cheerleading uniforms established by The Liebe Company (which was formerly contracted with Varsity), for copyright infringement over similarities in designs between their products. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Varsity, establishing that aesthetic elements of a useful article can be protected if they are a copyrightable artistic work, and are identifiable as art when mentally separated from the practical aspects of the item.\nIn 2017, BSN Sports CEO Adam Blumenfeld replaced Webb as CEO.\nIn July 2019, the company introduced a new division, \"Varsity Pro\", which focuses on providing apparel and services for professional cheer and dance teams, such as those of professional sports franchises. The division's first partnership as outfitter was with the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. It also acquired SA Feather Co. and Stanbury Uniforms to expand into the band market.\nOn December 9, 2020, Webb announced that he would step down from Varsity. In a 2021 interview with Sportico after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to recognize the ICU, Webb stated that he had divested himself of Varsity, recently had \"a very favorable liquidity event\", and \"was looking around with what I want to do with this phase of my life.\" Varsity's former vice president of corporate alliances and business development, Marlene Cota, stated that Webb's role in the company had begun to lessen after the sale to Charlesbank. After his departure, Webb became the new co-publisher and senior news editor of the conservative publication Human Events.\nAmerican Cheerleader was the first and largest national teen magazine dedicated to covering sideline and competitive cheerleading. It was founded in 1995 and based in Memphis, Tennessee. Staff included Editor-in-Chief Jackie Martin and Managing Editor Kim Conley. Inspired by the popularity and competitive nature of cheerleading in the early 1990s, publishing executive Michael Weiskopf started a magazine to take advantage of its evolving culture. The first issue was published in New York in January 1995. It was published by Lifestyle Ventures, LLC, and the first issue featured University of Maryland cheerleader Penny Ramsey, who went on to become a castaway in Thailand on the CBS show Survivor in 2002. Special Collector's Editions were produced in February 2005 and February 2010 to commemorate the magazine's 10th and 15th anniversaries. Lifestyle Media, Inc. was acquired by Macfadden Performing Arts Media, LLC in 2006. Varsity Spirit bought the magazine in 2012.American Cheerleader covered training tips for stunting and tumbling, tryout advice, team building activities, beauty, fashion, fitness and how to balance schoolwork and cheer. All issues feature a Cheerleader of the Month, Spotlight Squad and Awesome Athletes. 'Cheerleaders of the Month' were recognized for their talent, academic achievement and community involvement. Past celebrity covers have included Debby Ryan, Erica Joy Allen, Krystyna Krzeminski, Kendall Jenner, Heather Morris, Francia Raisa, Christina Milian, Kirsten Dunst, Mýa, Hilarie Burton, Ashley Tisdale, and Olivia Holt. American Cheerleader has also made its way into every sequel of the Bring It On films.\nTheir website, Americancheerleader.com, featured cheer news and trends, training tips, featured athletes and step by step videos of stunting, tumbling and cheer skills.\nVarsity Spirit has been described as having a monopoly position in cheerleading in the United States, due to extensive vertical integration of apparel businesses, training camps, affiliated gyms, cheerleading competitions, and sanctioning bodies, as well as acquisitions of competitors.Varsity has been accused of engaging in anti-competitive practices; the company signs gyms to multi-year agreements, under which they receive rebates if they exclusively purchase apparel from the company, and participate in Varsity-run competitions. Only Varsity-owned brands are allowed to exhibit and market their apparel at its events, hindering the ability for competitors to do the same. Although there are no restrictions on use of non-Varsity apparel by participants in the competitions proper, in 2010 Webb testified that in at least one competition, teams received more points if they used Varsity-produced props. \nVarsity also has effective control of affiliated governing bodies for cheerleading. USA Cheer, a non-profit governing body for cheerleading, was established by Varsity Spirit with a no-interest loan, and is staffed by six contracted Varsity Spirit employees. The U.S. All Star Federation (USASF), a governing body for private cheer and dance squads, was formed in 2003 with financial backing by Varsity Spirit via a no-interest loan. Although Varsity Spirit officially states that it does not own the USASF, its board was effectively controlled by Varsity Spirit by means of six of its 15 board members, and by-laws requiring seven seats to be filled by representatives of a group of Varsity Spirit-controlled cheerleading and dance associations. The company also paid the salary of its president, and its vice president of events and corporate alliances. In 2011, the USASF threatened to ban its members from participating in Varsity-run events if they participate in competing world championships not run by the company. Varsity was also involved in the establishment of the International Cheer Union (ICU). Under a \"Stay Smart\" scheme, attendees of events were also required to book accommodations with specific providers vouched by Varsity, which were accused of having paid kickbacks to the company.\nVarsity Spirit and its affiliates have lobbied against proposals for cheerleading to be sanctioned as a sport, including proposals by California, and Texas's University Interscholastic League (UIL), arguing that this would result in increased oversight and regulation that would be detrimental to its business and self-oversight. In 2015, the UIL announced a pilot \"Spirit Championship\", whose judges would be trained and provided by Varsity Spirit.In 2010, Webb was called upon as an expert witness in a Title IX case involving Quinnipiac University, which had redirected money out of women's sports to its all-women cheerleading team under the argument that it was a sport.  In his testimony, Webb stated that he did not consider cheerleading to be a sport, as he primarily considered Varsity's competitions to be a promotion for its lines of business. A federal judge held that cheerleading \"does not qualify as a varsity sport for the purposes of Title IX\".\nIn 2020, a proposed class action lawsuit was filed against Varsity Brands, alleging that it used its \"undue influence and control\" over affiliated bodies to maintain its monopoly in competitive cheerleading and scholastic apparel, including requiring participation in Varsity-run training camps in order to attend its competitions, participation in its insurance plans, and the aforementioned rebate program, which institutionalized financial costs for participation in competitive cheerleading. Varsity responded to the suit, arguing that they \"welcome the kind of competition that enhances the cheer marketplace\", and accused competitors of \"seeking to chill that marketplace through the Courts. We are contesting this flawed diversion from an otherwise dynamic industry with energy, resources and determination.\"In March 2023, Varsity Brands agreed to pay $43.5 million to settle one of the antitrust cases, Fusion Elite All Stars, et al. v. Varsity Brands LLC, et al,, targeting \"direct purchasers\"; under the settlement, Varsity agreed to stop paying the salaries of USASF executives, and prohibit its board members from occupying seats on the USASF board. In addition, the USASF agreed to not allow any one cheerleading body from controlling more than 40% of the voting seats on its board. In May 2024, Varsity settled Jessica Jones, et al., v. Varsity Brands, LLC, et al., with the company and its prior owners agreeing to pay out $82.5 million to \"indirect\" purchasers who paid for registration fees or purchased apparel from Varsity. As part of the settlement, Varsity also agreed to no longer require competitors to participate in its training camps, phase out the \"Stay Smart\" scheme, and to restrict the sharing of confidential information from other USASF members to Varsity..\nIn September 2020, USA Today published a report accusing governing bodies tied to Varsity Spirit of allowing 180 individuals (including coaches, choreographers, and others) indicted for child sexual abuse — 140 of whom having been convicted — to continue participating in activities. It found that their list of blacklisted individuals only contained 21 people, and was only amended and expanded following reports made by the paper.In September 2022, a federal lawsuit was filed in Memphis against Varsity Brands, Varsity Spirit, and the estate of Scott Foster (a gym owner who had killed himself while under investigation for child sexual abuse), by six alleged victims of Foster. The suit alleged negligence in violation of the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, including that Varsity made no effort to prohibit Foster from attending its sanctioned events, even after his suspension from the USASF in 2018.\nAll Varsity Spirit competitions follow a shared scoring system. This system varies slightly per team depending on the age, level, and coed of the division. Unlike previous seasons the 2021-2022 scoring system is based on 50 points instead of 100. This resulted in major shifts in the allocation of points within the sections of the cheerleading routines.Before the 2021-2022 season, the scoring system in Varsity Spirit and USASF governed competitions was straightforward. The scoring followed the main divisions of an all star cheerleading routine, stunts, pyramid, jumps, tosses, running tumbling, standing tumbling and dance. Each of these sections were allocated ten points, five for difficulty and five for execution except for dance. The scoring also allocated ten points for both performance and routine composition, five points to for stunt and pyramid creativity, and five points for stunt quantity. Lastly for coed teams five points were used to score coed stunts, non-coed teams were given a five. This scoring results in 100 possible points without deductions.\nThe 2021-2022 season scoring system changed most dramatically in that the major sections of the routine were no longer scored evenly. Stunts, pyramid, standing tumbling and running tumbling are allocated eight points, four for difficulty and four for execution; tosses and jumps were allocated four, two for difficulty and two for execution; and dance was only given two points. The amount allocated to routine composition dropped to two points while performance was dropped entirely, instead there are now two points allocated to a similar category, overall impression. Stunt and pyramid creativity are now allocated one point each. Another large change, mainly for all girl teams, is the change of the scoring sheet from coed teams to not coed teams. Meaning, coed teams still get scored on their coed stunts, unless they are an international team, however, the all-girl and international coed teams have the coed scoring section replaced with stunt quantity. This scoring results in 50 possible points which is doubled to obtain 100 possible points.\n",

        "doc": "A white label record is a vinyl record with white labels attached. There are several variations each with a different purpose.  Variations include test pressings, white label promos, and plain white labels.\nTest pressings, usually with test pressing written on the label, with catalogue number, artist and recording time or date, are the first vinyl discs made at the factory. Such discs are produced in very small quantities (usually no more than 5 or 6 copies) to evaluate the quality of the disc before mass production begins. A review of the test pressing may expose problems with the tape to disc transfer (mastering) and helps to ensure that the defective discs do not reach the public.In the United States, the term white label promo (often abbreviated as WLP) refers to a promotional pressing with a label that has mostly the same text and label logo/artwork as the commercial label, but with a white background instead of the color label or artwork found on commercial pressings. These are usually pressed in quantities of only a few thousand per title. Such copies may also contain biographies or pictures of the musical artists. Promotional copies are for distribution to journalists, music distributors or radio stations in order to assess consumer opinion.White label discs can be used to anonymously promote new artists or upcoming albums by veteran artists.  In some cases plain white labels are issued to conceal artist identities (examples of this include songs by Traci Lords and La Toya Jackson), whose record companies issued white labels so that DJs would have no pre-conceived notions about the music from the artist name. Many dance music producers press copies of white labels in order to test crowd response in dance clubs to their own musical productions.Today, white labels are usually produced in small amounts (fewer than 300) by small record companies or DJs and are most popular with club and hip-hop music DJs.  In the early 1990s, hardcore techno and house artists created tracks in home or local studios and had five-hundred or a few thousand singles pressed on 12\" white labels, which were easy to sell at dance music record stores.Steve Beckett of Warp Records recalls that \"shops would take fifty white labels off you for five pounds each, no problem.  Dance music was all imports, then people in Britain started doing it for themselves, and their tracks started to get better than the tunes in America.\"  Record labels like Warp, and Shut Up and Dance, were begun as white-label enterprises, providing cutting-edge dance music to pirate radio stations and music stores.\nSome white labels may contain unauthorized remixes or other recordings which are not licensed for release. Recordings not authorized by the artist or label are often called \"bootlegs\". White labels are referred to as \"promos\" (short for \"promotional copies\") that many top-name DJs receive and play weeks or months prior to the day of general release to the public. As artists using samples pay high fees for the privilege of such, they must be able to gauge the market potential of their tracks prior to approval. Recently, smaller promo services offer record companies a more economical means of distribution although these companies may not have the means to properly protect releases from illegal copying.The industry itself seems to be aware of this necessity and white labels are commonly accepted as a necessary evil within the industry, which has only prosecuted a small number of those artists using white labeled pressings of uncleared samples and compositions.\n",
