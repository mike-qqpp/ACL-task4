        "doc": "Work:family conflict occurs when an individual experiences incompatible demands between work and family roles, causing participation in both roles to become more difficult. This imbalance creates conflict at the work-life interface. It is important for organizations and individuals to understand the implications linked to work-family conflict. In certain cases, work:family conflict has been associated with increased occupational burnout, job stress, decreased health, and issues pertaining to organizational commitment and job performance.\nWork:family conflict was first studied in the late 19th century. During this time period, work and income moved from inside the home (agricultural work) to outside the home (factories). Industrialization challenged the current relationship between working and family.Boundary theory and border theory are the foundations used to study work-family conflict. Boundary theory divides social life into two interdependent sections, work and family. Individuals have different roles and responsibilities in each section. Since the sections are interdependent, two roles cannot take place at the same time. Individuals have to participate in role transformation between expectations of the workplace and expected roles within the family structure.\nBorder theory expands this by considering the influences each section has on the other. Border theory attempts to pin down ways to manage conflict and achieve balance between conflicting identities. Individuals may choose to treat these segments separately, moving back and forth between work and family roles (displaying boundary theory) or can decide to integrate the segments with hopes of finding balance.\nConflict between work and family is bi-directional. There is a distinction between what is termed work-to-family conflict and what is termed family-to-work conflict.Work-to-family conflict occurs when experiences and commitments at work interfere with family life, such as extensive, irregular, or inflexible work hours, work overload and other forms of job stress, interpersonal conflict at work, extensive travel, career transitions, or an unsupportive supervisor or organization. For example, an unexpected meeting late in the day may prevent a parent from picking up his or her child from school.\nFamily-to-work conflict occurs when experiences and commitments in the family interfere with work life, such as the presence of young children, primary responsibility for children, elder care responsibilities, interpersonal conflict within the family unit, or unsupportive family members. For example, a parent may need to take time off from work in order to take care of a sick child, or to witness a tournament or performance of a child. Family-to-work conflict is perceived to result in lower work productivity of employees.\nWithin work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, three subtypes of conflict have been identified: time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based. Time-based conflict entails competing time requirements across work and family roles, strain-based conflict entails pressures in one role impairing performance in the second role, and behavior-based conflict entails an incompatibility of behaviors necessary for the two roles.\nAlthough work interface with family (WIF) and family interface with work (FIW) are strongly correlated, more attention has been directed toward WIF. Research, largely attributed to the idea Ariel Russel Hochschild termed the \"ideal worker\", depicts the inelastic nature of work roles and responsibilities. The expectations employers hold of an \"ideal worker\" already rest on unrealistic assumptions about how the family should operate. Many employers expect that employees with families have someone tending to everything at home, leaving the worker unencumbered. Despite the fact that a majority of families in the U.S. are dual earning, the image of the \"ideal worker\" persists, presenting work-family conflict.\nWorkaholism correlates with experiences of work-to-family conflict, since one's priority of work may interfere with family commitments. In its simplest form, workaholism is said to be a substantial investment in one's work. One who is said to be involved in the act of workaholism can be labeled as a workaholic. Workaholism is said to be multifaceted and multi-directional. The flexibility and satisfaction within one's job has an impact on an employee's happiness and satisfaction in the home and vice versa. An overabundance of work has been said to take priority over everyone and everything else in the lives of those infatuated with work. Excessive work prevents one from forming and maintaining intimate relationships and close friendships. Workaholics are known to spend a vast amount of time in work-related activities, which then results in the sacrifice of crucial family, social, and recreational activities. Marital problems, trouble with maintaining close relationships, and isolation from friends and family are the common issues related to workaholism and those involved.In most recent years, employers have become more aware of the strain and stress that work can place on an employee. Companies have since started seeing their employees not only as workers, but also as people with personal and home lives. Implementation of family-responsive human resource practices and policies that promote work-family balance have become a reality as a way to reduce stress in both environments.\nWith the struggles of work-family conflict, options are necessary to provide a solution for these problems. Loehr and Schwartz compare the extreme demands experienced by an individual in the workplace to that of a professional athlete. In both scenarios energy expenditure (stress) is experienced. Without recovery (oscillation) both cannot perform to their greatest ability, eventually leading to chronic stress, burnout, and fatigue. Persist stress without oscillation and the result will be permanent damage.Creating an environment that values oscillation, for instance encouraging 15-minute walk breaks throughout the workday or offering corporate gym memberships, can improve employee cognition, energy, focus, and emotional intelligence. Companies, along with their bottom line and employees, win when mental and physical health are treated as equally important to cognitive capabilities. In order to gain competitive advantage, organizations are attempting to be portrayed as work:life balance:supportive employers. Companies that value employee work:life balance are able to attract and retain satisfied employees, improve worker performance, and boost employee morale and organization identification.\nWork:family conflict can be diminished by establishing family-friendly policies in the workplace. Some of these policies include maternity, paternity, parental, sick leaves, and health care insurance. Organizations may provide child care options either as an on-site child care center at the business, references to close child care centers, or supplemented child care incomes for the families placing their children in a child care center.\nWith advances in technology, individuals who work outside the home and have intense schedules are finding ways to keep in touch with their families when they cannot physically be together. \"Technology has provided a bit of an upper hand, allowing them unprecedented control and creativity in maneuvering the tenuous balance between work and family\" (Temple, 2009). Organizations are now able to implement remote work policies and provide more flextime.\nThe role of gender is a large factor in work-family conflict because one's gender may determine their role in the home or work place. Female representation in the workplace is a direct result of power operating covertly through ideological controls. This is illustrated by the basic assumption of an \"ideal worker.\" Many organizations view the ideal worker as one who is \"committed to their work above all else\". Ideal workers are those that complete tasks beyond their formal and assigned behaviors, seen as a positive and valuable attribute to the organization. Individuals having to divide their time (and their commitments) between family and work are perceived as less dedicated to the organization. A manager's perception of a subordinate's role and commitment to the organization is positively associated with the individual's promotability.Manager expectations of an ideal worker are often placed on female workers. Since female workers are both part of the workforce and have significant responsibilities at home, they experience a greater bearing of work-life conflict. Families in Germany with at least one child under the age of 13 and both parents in the labor force in 2018 saw moms devote nearly three times as much time to child care than fathers did. A new study suggested that women tend to face more work-family conflict than men because women have lower control over work and schedules than men. Female employees, who managers perceive to be juggling work and family commitments, were presumed to be less committed to the organization, therefore not worthy of advancement.  Women in the workforce may be \"inaccurately perceived to have less commitment to their organizations than their counterparts. Their advancement in organizations may be unfairly obstructed\". Males are perceived to be extremely dedicated to their organization because they experience lower levels of work-family conflict.\nA male individual may be unmarried and have no thought as to what \"typical\" family responsibilities entail because they simply have not had the experience.  The male may be married, but his wife, due to the demands of the husband's position, has remained at home, tending solely to the house and children and experiencing the \"typical\" family responsibilities. Since the wife is the one who stays home and tends to the children, the husband is more present in the workforce, representing the higher percentage of males at the top of the organization hierarchy. Ironically, these are the individuals creating and reforming workplace policies.\nThe motherhood penalty is a term sociologists use when arguing that in the workplace working mothers encounter systematic disadvantages in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women. In their place of work, women may suffer a per-child wage penalty, leading to a pay gap between mothers and non-mothers that is larger than the gap between men and women. Not only do working mothers have the burden of balancing work and home life, but they also have to prove they are as dedicated as other employees. Mothers tend to suffer less favorable job-site evaluations compared to non-mothers, stating that mothers are much less committed to their jobs, less authoritative, and less dependable than non-mothers. Hence, mothers may experience discrimination is terms of pay, hiring, and day-to-day job experience.\nThe way in which companies have shaped the \"ideal worker\" does not complement the family lifestyle, nor does it accommodate it.  Long hours and near complete devotion to the profession make it difficult for working mothers to participate in, or get ahead in the workplace while maintaining a home and family.\n",

        "title": "Anti-social_Media_Bill_(Nigeria)",
        "doc": "Anti-social Media Bill was introduced by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on 5 November 2019 to criminalise the use of the social media in peddling false or malicious information. The original title of the bill is Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill 2019. It was sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa from the largely conservative northern Nigeria. After the bill passed second reading on the floor of the Nigeria Senate and its details were made public, information emerged on the social media accusing the sponsor of the bill of plagiarising a similar law in Singapore which is at the bottom of global ranking in the freedom of speech and of the press. But the senator denied that he plagiarised Singaporean law.\nAngry reactions trailed the introduction of the bill, and a number of civil society organisations, human rights activists, and Nigerian citizens unanimously opposed the bill. International rights group, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned the proposed legislation saying it is aimed at gagging freedom of speech which is a universal right in a country of over two hundred million people.Opposition political parties are very critical of the bill and accused the government of attempting to strip bare, Nigerian citizens of their rights to free speech and destroying same social media on whose power and influence the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC came to power in 2015. Nigeria Information Minister, Lai Mohammed has been at the center of public criticism because he is suspected to be the brain behind the proposed act. Lai was a  former spokesman of then opposition All Progressives Congress.\nA \"Stop the Social Media Bill! You can no longer take our rights from us\" online petition campaign to force the Nigeria parliament to drop the bill received over 90,000 signatures within 24 hours. In November 2019, after the bill passed second reading in the senate, Akon Eyakenyi, a senator from Akwa Ibom State publicly said he would resist the bill.\nThose who support the proposed act especially Senators have often argued that the law would help curtail hate speech. President Muhammad Buhari who is seen as a beneficiary of the influence and power of the social media and free speech has been mute about it. But the president's senior aides and family members have publicly spoken in support of the bill. In November 2019, the wife of the president, Aisha Buhari, told a gathering at the Nigeria's National Mosque in the capital, Abuja that if China with over one billion people could regulate the social media, Nigeria should do same. But Nigerians reacted saying Nigeria is not a one-party communist state like China. Days later, a daughter to the president, Zahra Indimi told a gathering of young people in Abuja that social media had become a potent weapon for bullying those they thought were doing better than them in terms of social class and called for a critical regulation.Protection from Internet Falsehoods, Manipulations and Other Related Matters Bill 2019.This Act is to prevent Falsehoods and Manipulations in Internet transmission and correspondences in Nigeria.To suppress falsehoods and manipulations and counter the effects of such communications and transmissions and to sanction offenders with a view to encouraging and enhancing transparency by Social Media Platforms using the internet correspondences.\nOne objective of the bill is to prevent the transmission of false statements or declaration of facts in Nigeria.Another objective of the bill is to end the financing of online mediums that transmit false statements.\nMeasures will be taken to detect and control inauthentic behaviour and misuse of online accounts (parody accounts).\nWhen paid content is posted towards a political end, there will be measures to ensure the poster discloses such information.\nThere will be sanction for offenders.\nAccording to the bill, a person must not:Transmit a statement that is false or,\nTransmit a statement that might:\ni. Affect the security or any part of Nigeria. ii. Affect public health, public safety or public finance. iii. Affect Nigeria's relationship with other countries. iv. influence the outcome of an election to any office in a general election. v. Cause enmity or hatred towards a person or group of persons.\nAnyone guilty of the above is liable to a fine of N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both (for individual); and a fine not exceeding ten million naira (for corporate organisations).\nSame punishment applies for fake online accounts that transmit statements listed above.\nThe bill says a person shall not open an account to transmit false statement.Anyone found guilty will be fined N200,000 or three years' imprisonment or both (for an individual) or five million naira (for corporate organisations).\nIf such accounts transmit a statement that will affect security or influence the outcome of an election, such a person will be fined N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both.\nIf a person receives payment or reward to help another to transmit false statements knowingly, he/she is liable to a fine of N150,000 or three years' imprisonment or both. If a person receives payment or reward to help another to transmit a statement affects security or influence the outcome of an election, the fine is N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both (for individual) and ten million naira for organisations.\nAccording to the bill, a law enforcement department can issue a \"declaration\" to offenders. And this declaration will be issued even if the \"false statement\" has been corrected or pulled down.The offender will be required to publish a \"correction notice\" in a specified newspaper, online location or other printed publication of Nigeria.\nFailure to comply, a person is liable to N200,000 or 12 months' imprisonment or both (for individual) and five million naira for organisations.\nThe bill says the law enforcement department will also issue an access blocking order to offenders.The law enforcement department may direct the NCC to order the internet access service provider to disable access by users in Nigeria to the online location and the NCC must give the internet access service provider an access blocking order.\nAn internet access service provider that does not comply with any access blocking order is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding ten million naira for each day during any part of which that order is not fully complied with, up to a total of five million naira.\n",

In February 2015, he was terminated by Mediakraft for swearing during a broadcast with his followers on Periscope, and in April 2015 he created a personal channel for himself.\nOn 1 November 2017, he committed suicide in his house in ÃœskÃ¼dar, Istanbul for an unknown reason, without leaving a will behind. When his relatives, who had not heard from him for a long time, reported the situation, the door of his house was opened in the presence of a locksmith and the police and they saw that Korkmaz had hanged himself using a rope.",

Hyperdata enables the formation of a web of data, evolving from the \"data on the Web\" that is not inter-related (or at least, not linked).\nIn the same way that hypertext usually refers to the World Wide Web but is a broader term, hyperdata usually refers to the Semantic Web, but may also be applied more broadly to other data-linking technologies such as microformats : including XHTML Friends Network.\nA hypertext link indicates that a link exists between two documents or \"information resources\". Hyperdata links go beyond simply such a connection, and express semantics about the kind of connection being made. For instance, in a document about Hillary Clinton, a hypertext link might be made from the word senator to a document about the United States Senate. In contrast, a hyperdata link from the same word to the same document might also state that senator was one of Hillary Clinton's roles, titles, or positions (depending on the ontology being used to define this link).\nThe Semantic Web introduces the controversial concept of links to non-data resources. In the Semantic Web, links are not limited to \"information resources\" or documents, such as the typical Web page. Hyperdata links may refer to a physical structure (e.g., \"the Eiffel Tower\"), a place (\"Champ de Mars\" where the Eiffel Tower stands), a person (Gustave Eiffel, the man responsible for the tower's construction), or other \"non-information resources\". The links in this article are hypertext, not hyperdata, and they all lead to documents which describe the entities named.A hyperdata browser (also called a Semantic Web browser), is a browser used to navigate the Semantic Web. Semantic Web architecture does not necessarily involve the HTML document format, which typical HTML Web browsers rely upon. A hyperdata browser specifically requests RDF data from Web servers, often through content negotiation or conneg, starting from the same URL as the traditional Web browser; the Web server may immediately return the requested RDF, or it may deliver a redirection to a new URI where the RDF may actually be found, or the RDF may be embedded in the same HTML document which would be returned to a Web browser which did not request RDF. The RDF data will generally describe the resource represented by the originally requested URI. The hyperdata browser then renders the information received as an HTML page that contains hyperlinks for users to navigate to indicated resources.\n",
